Title: Can I still come if I have doubts?
----
Text: Yes, for sure! The message is not "change, then come". No, it's "come as you are and receive God's kindness and grace through the Gospel". Transformation comes as we look to Christ and learn to trust Godâ€™s character in every area of our lives. Come and see for yourself and then go and share with others.
