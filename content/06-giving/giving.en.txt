Text: The strength of our Church can be found in the generosity and commitment of its people. Proverbs 21:26 says ‘the godly love to give’ (TLB), this is seen through the countless volunteer hours offered to run community programs, in those serving in church services and through those who financially support the church and its initiatives.

We believe in the Biblical principle of tithing. In Malachi 3:10 (NLT) the Bible talks about bringing the first 10% (tithe) of your income into the storehouse (church). Tithes and Offerings received at Berlin Connect fund the vision and activities of our church.
