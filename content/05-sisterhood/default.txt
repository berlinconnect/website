Text: Sisterhood is passionate about placing value on women of all ages and empowering them to flourish in every season of life.

We believe that collectively we can make a difference locally and globally and endeavour to gather, equip and mobilise women to be part of the solution.

We get together for morning tea every Thursday from 10:30 to 12:30 at the ‘Hub’ Weinbergsweg 24, where we are inspired, encouraged, have fun, receive input, pray and outwork the vision of our church.
