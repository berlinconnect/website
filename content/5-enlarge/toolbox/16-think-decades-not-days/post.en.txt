**KEY POINTS:**
1. God works through decades, not days
2. He allows us to go through tests, seeing if we can look after what doesn’t belong to us, and serve even when times are hard.
3. When we take responsibility, we show God He can trust us with increase.
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**

We **overestimate** what God can do in a year, but **underestimate** what He can do in ten. God thinks generationally, and He works through **decades, not days**. Days go up and down, but it’s in the decades that we discover God’s message and vision for our lives.
<br>
**Responsibility means INCREASE**

Anything of value in our world has been tested - like the computers and gadgets we buy. Likewise, God tests us. How? He entrusts with **things that don’t belong to us**, and we’re tested on how well we **take responsibility** and look after them.
<br>
**Genesis 37: 1-2 (MSG) **
Meanwhile Jacob had settled down where his father had lived, the land of Canaan. This is the story of Jacob. The story continues with Joseph, seventeen years old at the time, helping out his brothers in herding the flocks. These were his half brothers actually, the sons of his father’s wives Bilhah and Zilpah. And Joseph brought his father bad reports on them.

Joseph’s brothers hated him for taking responsibility. But that’s how God **brings increase** to our lives: by **giving us responsibility**. Joseph was later alienated from his family and sold into slavery, but kept serving:
<br>
**Genesis 39:2-4 (NLT)**
The Lord was with Joseph, so he succeeded in everything he did as he served in the home of his Egyptian master. Potiphar noticed this and realized that the Lord was with Joseph, giving him success in everything he did. This pleased Potiphar, so he soon made Joseph his personal attendant. He put him in charge of his entire household and everything he owned.

Even in hardship and injustice, Joseph served in another man’s home and began to implement the **vision** God had put in his heart. And what happened? He was given more and more responsibility!
<br>
**Genesis 41:14-15 (TLB)**
Pharaoh sent at once for Joseph. He was brought hastily from the dungeon, and after a quick shave and change of clothes, came in before Pharaoh. “I had a dream last night,” Pharaoh told him, “and none of these men can tell me what it means. But I have heard that you can interpret dreams, and that is why I have called for you.”

If we prove we can be **faithful** with things that don’t belong to us, people will call upon us and **trust us** when major challenges arise. It’s about serving the Lord with gladness, no matter what our situation. Do we just serve when everything’s good? No: we serve because **serving is who we are**. 

In **Genesis 41:37-46** Joseph is then promoted by Pharaoh, and - aged 30 - is effectively placed in charge of Egypt.

Let’s tune in to what God wants for our lives. We’re not here for our own vanity and comfort: we’re here to **add value to the world**. God is solution-orientated, and He brings the world’s solutions through us! Our achievements are never wasted in God’s hands

But we have to work **under authority** before we can **have authority**. If we do life God’s way, we’ll find ourselves in places we could never put ourselves - but **God needs to know He can trust us**! And it starts now. Joseph developed the character of a leader before he became a leader: likewise, let’s think about **where God wants us to head**, and make the changes and adjustments now. Let’s not dress where we are now… let’s dress where we’re going.
<br>
**CONCLUSION: **

Joseph faithfully served others his whole life. He worked under authority, looking after things that didn’t belong to him and treating them with great value - so **God knew He could trust him** with greater and greater responsibility. 

But it didn’t happen in days… it happened over **decades**. Joseph was 17 at the start of the story. By age 30, he was in charge of Egypt. He spent those 13 years making the changes and adjustments needed to take on this role. 13 years **implementing God’s vision**.
<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK:**

Are we taking responsibility, showing we** can be trusted**, and living the kind of life where someone is making plans to promote us? When we’re looking after something that doesn’t belong with us, do we **treat it with value**? Can **we serve someone else’s vision**, sometimes before our own?

It’s about seeing how God wants to **shape us for our future**, and making the changes we need to **implement God’s vision**. And it won’t happen overnight: God’s plan for us is long-term. So let’s start trying to think in decades rather than days!
