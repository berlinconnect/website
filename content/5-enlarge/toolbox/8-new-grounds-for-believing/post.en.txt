**KEY POINTS:**
1. Sometimes it is hard to consistently have faith in God. Jesus acknowledged that some people had ‘great faith’ and others ‘little faith’.
2. The bible is full of stories that seemed unlikely and impossible, but that’s where God comes through.
3. When we have faith and let God work in our lives, it builds more faith and gives us *new grounds for believing* - seeing the impossible become possible!
 <br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**
We need faith in all areas of our lives – in our families, marriages, businesses, ... If you watch, children have uncomplicated faith, but adults complicate faith and try to make it a formula - but it can be easy.
 
In the Bible there were two times where Jesus said someone had ‘**great faith**’.
**1. Matthew 8:5-13.** The Centurion. He knew Jesus didn’t even need to be present to heal someone. Jesus said he had ‘great faith’.
**2. Matthew 15:21-28.** The Canaanite woman. She was incredibly persistent in asking Jesus for help, and so Jesus also called hers a ‘great faith’.
 
On the other hand, Jesus was often frustrated with the disciples and their lack of faith, calling them ‘you of **little faith**’ (eg. Matthew 8:26)
 
**Hebrews 11:1 (NIV) Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.**
 
Confidence. Hope. Assurance. Many believers struggle with these things. But it’s God’s will that we have them. How can we offer our neighbor hope if we ourselves are hopeless? How can we offer confidence to a work colleague if we have none?

The definition of doubt is to lack confidence; to consider unlikely; uncertainty; lack of conviction.
If we read through the Bible we see all the men and women of faith were just like you and I. They were ordinary people but they **made choices** to be men and women of faith. Theirs are stories that would be considered **unlikely**. 
 
**If it's considered unlikely that’s where God loves to be.** Why? Because people don’t get the glory - God does.

In the story of Lazarus (John 11) Jesus was asked to come and heal him, but he didn’t come right away and Lazarus actually died. Yet Jesus said: 
**(John 11:14-15 MSG) “Lazarus died. And I am glad for your sakes that I wasn’t there. You’re about to be given new grounds for believing.”**
 <br>
**CONCLUSION**
No matter what is going on, God wants to use it to give you new grounds for believing. And when this happens we will say “it was only Him, only God could do it”, and we will give him the glory for it. Let God expand our thinking, and do something on the inside of us that causes us to believe who He is and to grow our faith.

**THOUGHT FOR THE WEEK**
Where are we at in our lives – do we have great faith or little faith?
What is it in your life that would be considered so unlikely? Trust God in this and believe that with Him the impossible can become possible.
