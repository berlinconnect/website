**KEY POINTS:**
1. There are two kinds of frustration: a **drive for improvement**, which is healthy, and the **curse of comparison**, which is unhealthy.
2. We can **manage** our healthy frustrations, and live **satisfied and contented** in God’s will.
3. This is a **choice** that we have to make.
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**

**Philippians 4:11-13 (NIV)**
“I am not saying this because I am in need, for **I have learned to be content** whatever the circumstances. I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. I can do all this through him who gives me strength.”

Many of us are **dissatisfied** with who and where we are. Sooner or later, we all find ourselves stuck in the gap between **expectations and experience**. It leaves us **frustrated** and dissatisfied, and we ask “**Where is God in this?**” But we can learn to manage this tension. And when we manage it, we experience the contentment described by Paul. This is God’s will for us!

Paul has a joy **no situation** can rob from him - which tells us it’s possible to live with satisfaction, even when times are hard. He also says **“I have learned,”** telling us he had to **intentionally** dedicate himself to this! It gives us all hope that we **can** learn things that seem foreign to us.
<br>
**The different kinds of frustration**

**The drive to improve (healthy frustration)**
Anyone with **vision** is frustrated! Paul had passion and direction, and he wanted improvement. And frustration is a **driver of improvement**. If we don’t have it, we don’t move forward. So frustration doesn’t need to be resolved; it needs to be **managed**. It’s about learning how to strive in the right areas and **let go of the wrong**.
<br>
**FRUSTRATION** leads to **EVALUATION**, which leads to **IMPROVEMENT**

**The curse of comparison (unhealthy frustration)**
Comparison is seeing what someone else has and thinking “**I want THAT!**” We can be smack bang in the will of God, in exactly the right place, but convince ourselves we’re in the wrong place because of comparison. We torture ourselves thinking “**If I had what they had, I’d be happy...**”

**COMPARISON** leads to **UNHEALTHY FRUSTRATION**, which leads to us **CONFUSING OUR WANTS AND NEEDS**.

**Galatians 6:4-5 (NLT)**
“Pay careful attention to your own work, for then you will get the satisfaction of a job well done, and you won’t need to compare yourself to anyone else. For we are each responsible for our own conduct.”

Paul is saying: “**Stay in your lane!**” We each have a specific calling, so let’s do the best with what we have in our hand, even if we think our tasks are below us. 

**2 Corinthians 12 (NIV)**
“When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise.”

**1 Timothy 6:6-8 (NIV)**
“But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that.”
We can get lost in the complexity offered by western civilisation. But the question is: do these luxuries **own us**, or do we use them to f**acilitate the call of God on our lives**? They can actually make life more stressful. Paul says **simplicity** is key to living a contented life. So let’s keep it simple, and do good with **what we have in our hand**.
<br>
**How can we develop contentment?**

**Philippians 4:4-8 (NLT)**
“Always be full of joy in the Lord. I say it again—rejoice! Let everyone see that you are considerate in all you do. Remember, the Lord is coming soon. Don’t worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done. Then you will experience God’s peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus. And now, dear brothers and sisters, one final thing. **Fix your thoughts on what is true**, and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable. Think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise.”
<br>
**Our mind is the battlefield!  **
Happiness doesn’t just fall into our lives, it’s a **daily struggle**. The kingdom of God is fighting to break into this world, and we’ve got to wrestle it into our minds. Let’s admit our struggles and take **responsibility** for disciplining our thoughts. The Holy Spirit can help, but we’ve got to **choose **to focus on good, not negative. 

**Be continually grateful**
Sometimes we put out our hands and say: “**God, give to me**” but he shows us a path and says: “**walk towards me.**” Everything we do with God is a partnership. When we childishly ask God to give, He says: “**No my child. I love you, but I need to teach you this process of discipline and growing. Come, start to trust me, start to speak out what you want to see.**”

**CONCLUSION: **
When our frustration is a **drive for improvement**, we can manage it and still find contentment. But when we’re frustrated because of **comparison** - because we want what someone else has - we cannot find contentment.
<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK: **
What are the things frustrating us right now? And where does that frustration come from? If it comes from **comparisons **with other people, and jealousy of what others have, let’s make a choice to discipline our minds. Let’s learn to stay focused on the things God has given us individually, and the **plans he has for us**. When we **do good with what God has put in our hands**, we find contentment.
