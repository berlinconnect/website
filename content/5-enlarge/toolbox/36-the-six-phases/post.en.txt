**KEY POINTS:**
1. Our relationship with God is a **process**, and God wants to use it to **help us grow**.
2. It’s great to have a vision – but we also have to be prepared to make **decisions** to achieve that vision, and to bear some **pain** on the way.
3. Not everything happens immediately: there is a **delay** between sowing the seeds and reaping the harvest, but God **WILL** deliver us. 
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**
Our walk with God is a process that can be summed up in **six phases**. 
During this process, God builds our character – and understanding the process helps us to work through questions like “**Why is this happening to me?**” and “**Why me, Lord?**”. It helps us to work **with** God, rather than fighting against him.
Our capacity to grow stronger is determined by our **pain tolerance**. In sport, muscles get torn, which hurts – but when they repair themselves they get **larger and stronger**. This can be used as a metaphor for what God is doing in our lives.
God can use pain and difficult situations to **stretch and form our faith muscles**, and help us become bigger as people. Some people **slow down or stop** when things get painful, and some **push through**. God wants to help us all to push through.
<br>
**These are the SIX PHASES:**
<br>
**1. Dream | Vision.**
This is where everything starts. God has put a vision in our heart, and the vision is strong. It’s up to us to be **sensitive** of what God is putting in our heart, but we can also know that God has **way more** up His sleeve than we can even think, pray or imagine at this stage.
The vision should be simple, and clear – so clear that someone who **runs by us** can take a quick glimpse and see it in us. For example, in simplest terms, the vision of the church is helping people to **find Jesus and walk with him**.
<br>
**2. Decision. **
Many people dream, but only around 1 in 10 people will **put their dream into action**. Many Christians dream of a ‘**revival**’, where God comes and transforms the country, saving many people. But ask these people: “**What are the steps, choices and decisions needed to achieve this?**” and they often go silent. 
Around 1 in 10 people make the decision to **invest into their vision**, work with God on the vision, and make good quality choices. This is a powerful step. Invest into what God has put in your heart.

**James 1:6 (NIV) **
But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.
<br>
**3. Delay. **
Now we’re investing time, energy and money into what God has put in our heart - but things don’t go as fast as we hoped. There is a waiting time between **sowing the seeds** and **reaping the harvest**. But remember: there is a big difference between “**no**” and “**not yet**”.
So what do we do during the delay? Well, often God has something for us to work on, to help us get ready for the calling on our life. He’s saying: “**There are a few things I want you to help with in the preparation.**”
<br>
**4. Problems. **
Things happen that we didn’t expect. These can come in two forms:
Criticisms, and 
Circumstances that don’t work for us. 
But God is still in the process, and He is preparing our heart:

**1 Peter 1:6-7 **
In all this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials. These have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith - of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire - may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.

Things happen, but everything is only for a while. God is still there and he will turn things around for us. If we still believe God in the troubled times, and we put our trust and faith in him even when things look dark, that’s more precious than gold. 
<br>
**5. Dead end street. **
This is where we start to think: “**I don’t know if this is ever going to work… it’s going nowhere!**” The situation has worsened, from difficult to impossible. It looks hopeless.

**2 Corinthians 1:8-10 (NIV) **
We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about the troubles we experienced in the province of Asia. We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired of life itself. Indeed, we felt we had received the sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead. He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us again. On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us. 

Paul thought he couldn’t go on any longer – and that wasn’t Paul’s fault. But God didn’t leave him. Likewise, there is **nothing wrong with us** if we find ourselves in this situation, feeling like we cannot go on. But we can remember that God is still **with us**, still **loves us** and still **has the answer**.
This is the turning point of the process: it’s where **God comes into the picture**. Here, we realise that we **have to** rely on God, but we also **want to** rely on Him. It’s a constant choice we have to make: to rely on God rather than on ourselves, and to remember that **He has done miracles and He can do them again.**
When we rely on God, our dead end street becomes a **highway for his blessings.**
In moments of discouragement it’s also **so important** to have people around you. There are people we need around **us**, and there are also people who need us to be around **them**. God wants to put people in our world – so let’s receive them!
<br>
**6. Deliverance. **
If God can raise people from the dead, he can definitely change our circumstances. On Him we have set our hope. **He will deliver us again. **
**Suddenly**, God changes things. This is how He works: **Suddenly** he will provide, changing things around, and **light will break through** into a dark situation. Miraculously, things **will** fall into place. God can raise things from the dead, and He can do miracles in our lives.
<br>
**Psalm 27:13/4 KJV**
I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.
Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.
<br>
**CONCLUSION: **
If we find ourselves asking: “**Why is this happening to me, God?**” it’s worth remembering that we are only at **one stage** of the process. And if we rely on God, and **trust Him** through the delays, the problems and the apparent dead ends, the end is **ALWAYS** deliverance.
<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK:** 
What is our **vision**? What are the **decisions** we have to face to make this vision a reality? Are we prepared to put up with some **pain** to achieve it? And do we trust God to **deliver us**, despite all the problems and delays ahead of us?
