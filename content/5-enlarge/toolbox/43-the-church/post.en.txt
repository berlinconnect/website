Text:

The word “Church” comes from the Greek word ekklesia which means “called out ones”. Other references to the Church are: the people of God, the collective body of believers; the congregation, the Body of Christ, the Lords house.

**WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY ABOUT THE CHURCH?**
He is in charge of it all, has the final word on everything. At the center of all this, Christ rules the Church. The Church, you see, is not peripheral to the world; the world is peripheral to the Church. The Church is Christ’s body, in which he speaks and acts, by which he fills everything with his presence.  | EPHESIANS 1:23 MSG

**WE ARE THE CHURCH**
You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot. You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. | MATTHEW 5:13-14  NIV

The Church is the pillar and foundation of the Truth on the earth | 1 TIMOTHY 3:15 NLV

The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree. He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. Those who are planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God. They shall still bear fruit in old age. They shall be fresh and flourishing | PSALM 92:12-14 NKJV

**SIGNS OF A HEALTHY HOUSE**
They worshiped together at the Temple each day, met in homes for the Lord’s Supper, and shared their meals with great joy and generosity — all the while praising God and enjoying the goodwill of all the people. And each day the Lord added to their fellowship
those who were being saved. | ACTS 2:46-47 NLT 

Make room in your life for:
The Church - at the weekend, belonging and contributing to a place called Home.
Doing life together mid-week. A strong sense of community, with people caring for one another building great friendships and relationships.
Personal prayer - our prayer life is our responsibility not someone else’s.
Applying God’s Word - be quick to apply God’s word in every area of your life.
Sharing - whatever you share grows. Have a generous stance in life.
Communion - Communion is about a common union; remembering what Jesus has done for us - a brand new life in Christ.

The Church is God’s plan for communicating the message about the way back to Him. It is magnetic, turning friends into family and giving all a sense of belonging and purpose. The Church is the hope of the world, the vehicle for bringing lost people back into relationship with Him.
