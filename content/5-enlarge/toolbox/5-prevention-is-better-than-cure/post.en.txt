**KEY POINTS:**

1. Prevention is better than cure, it costs more to repair than to prevent things to start with.
2. What is the role of the church? To “pick up the pieces”, and to bring prevention.
3. The role of the church is to contribute to the wellbeing of the city by adding value to the marketplace (= your sphere of influence).

**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**

**Romans 10:1-17 (NLT)** _(link: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NLT&search=Romans%2010 text: Read it here)_
 
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure means that **prevention is better than picking up the pieces after**. This expression came from Benjamin Franklin about how to prevent house fires. It was less expensive to practice fire safety than to rebuild a house that burned down. 

The same is true for our lives:
It is better to prevent problems than fix them once they arise.
Humility is more cost effective than pride. Be a person of humility because pride costs a lot.
It costs more to bring health to sick people, than to prevent sickness.
It costs less to take responsibility, but more to avoid responsibility.

**Ephesians 4:11-12 (CEV)
Christ chose some of us to be apostles, prophets, missionaries, pastors, and teachers, so that his people would learn to serve and his body would grow strong.**
 
Every role in life has a different purpose and responsibility.
The role of **parents** is to prepare their kids for life. God puts children in a family so they can be nurtured and developed, and to learn skills to do life well. 
The role of a **pastor** is to guide you to your God-given potential - not to manipulate or control you or tell you how to live, but to point you to your potential. 
The role of a **shepherd** is to help the sheep find green pastures. Jesus is our shelpherd like in Psalm 23, and pastors are also like sub-shepherds in our lives.  
The role of a **friend** is to help you get over yourself! They aren’t around to agree with you all the time, but to tell you when you’re talking or acting crazy, to help you get back on track and - still love you.  
The role of the **church** is to help you know Christ and to make Him known.  
 
**Jeremiah 29:4-7 (MSG) 
This is the Message from God-of-the-Angel-Armies, Israel’s God, to all the exiles I’ve taken from Jerusalem to Babylon: “Build houses and make yourselves at home. Put in gardens and eat what grows in that country. Marry and have children. Encourage your children to marry and have children so that you’ll thrive in that country and not waste away. Make yourselves at home there and work for the country’s welfare. Pray for Babylon’s well-being. If things go well for Babylon, things will go well for you.”**

Every city, like Berlin, has a sphere of trade and commerce. And the city also has the church - in Berlin around 5000 people attend church each weekend from a population of 3.5 million. If we’re being honest, the city doesn’t really care that much about the church. But the city is interested in trade and commerce. So **our role is to add value to the marketplace** wherever we find ourselves. We can contribute to the wellbeing of the city through the marketplace and trade. We bring integrity and God’s values to the table and as the marketplace starts to change, the city will start to change. We need an economy that has a sense of morality and ethics, and that’s where God’s people can start to contribute now as an act of prevention.

**CONCLUSION: **
Prevention is better than cure, but **what happens when we do need a cure?**
The role of the church is to help pick up the pieces. Maybe you’re broken on the inside, and feel like you’re in a million pieces - trust broken, lacking purpose, failed relationships. We can’t just say prevention is better than cure, we are called to do both - to pick up the pieces and start prevention. The church’s role is to bring health, restoration and healing for a broken generation.

**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK: **
Where can you work on prevention in your sphere of influence? Where can you help pick up the pieces?
How can you add value to our city through your sphere of influence and the role you are in?
