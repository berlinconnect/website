**KEY POINTS:**
1. Kindness is a fruit of the Holy Spirit, which God has placed inside us and which we can now nurture and develop.
2. Kindness is something we have to plan. Just as we decide what to wear in the morning, we also decide to clothe ourselves in kindness.
3. Before we can extend kindness to other people, we have to accept the kindness that we receive from God. We can’t give what we don’t have!
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**
**What is kindness?**
**Oxford Dictionary definition**: The quality of being friendly, generous, and considerate.
Kindness allows us to do **good** to others. It isn’t just a state of mind - it’s something we express in our thoughts, words and deeds. Biblical kindness always involves **action**!
<br>
Kindness is a language that everyone can understand, but it’s something we are desperately lacking in our world. Jesus placed value on us – and we can place value on others with our kindness.
<br>
**The fruit of the Holy Spirit**
Jesus may no longer be here on Earth with us, but he didn’t leave us alone: he sent the Holy Spirit to be with us. The same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead **also lives in us**. The Holy Spirit does and is many things. This is what He **DOES**:
<br>
**John 14:26 (NLT)**
26 But when the Father sends the Advocate as my representative—that is, the Holy Spirit—he will teach you everything and will remind you of everything I have told you.
<br>
**John 16:13 (NLT)**
When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own but will tell you what he has heard. He will tell you about the future.
But it’s not just about what He does: it’s about what He **IS**:
<br>
**Galatians 5:22 (NLT)**
But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness
<br>
The Holy Spirit does what he does **because** of who he is. Kindness is the **fruit of the Holy Spirit**. 
<br>
**WHY we can be kind**
Thinking about the **HOW** and the **WHAT** will only get us so far. If we understand **WHY** we are doing something, it changes it from something we **“have to do”** to something we **“love to do!”** So, why can we be kind?
<br>
**The character of God**
God has given us His divine nature and character. The seeds of the Holy Spirit’s fruit are **in us**. It’s now our job to nurture and develop the seeds so the fruit can grow. Fruit is different to the **gifts** God has given us. Gifts are our talents, unique as God has chosen them for us – but He gives the Holy Spirit’s fruit to **all of us equally**. Gifts are what we do, but the fruit of the Holy Spirit is who we **ARE**.
<br>
**How can we develop kindness?**
This isn’t something that just happens. We have to mean to do it. 
<br>
Nobody stepped outside this morning and expected to be automatically covered with clothes. It’s something we know we have to do ourselves. In the same way we plan to put on clothes, we also have to plan to clothe ourselves in kindness! But before we can give kindness, we have to receive it. We can’t give what we don’t have! God gave us kindness – and only when we submit to Him by accepting this kindness will we be able to extend it to others.
<br>
**CONCLUSION: **
We have kindness placed within us by God, and it’s now our job to **nurture and develop the seeds**. When we submit to God and receive the kindness He has given us, we can clothe ourselves in it and **actively** extend kindness to others, placing value on them as Jesus places value on us.
<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK: **
Focus on the **WHY** when it comes to kindness. Why can we extend kindness? Because it is the fruit of the Holy Spirit, which God has placed inside us. If we understand the **WHY**, then the **HOW** and the **WHAT** will follow.
