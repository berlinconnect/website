2. This is a promise God made to us, and he will not forsake us.
3. We need Jesus more than anything else.
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**

**Isaiah 9:6 (NIV)**
For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
This is a declaration, and a **promise**. But it’s not just an ancient promise – it’s a promise for **today**. It’s a promise of **Jesus**.
God’s love isn’t some random, abstract, crazy thing. God’s love is **personal**. It knows our name.
Fear is an enemy, and it’s scary how quickly it can take hold of us. We have to **not let fear dominate**. There is pain and suffering all around us - but with the Prince of Peace, there is also **hope** for us all.
What does the Prince of Peace say to us? He says: you are important, you are not forsaken, and you are **not forgotten**.
So what’s the message of Christmas? It’s that God didn’t abandon us – he gave us a saviour.
Our greatest need is a saviour called Jesus. In our world today, we need the message of Christmas and the Prince of Peace like never before.
The biggest issue in our world is loneliness – and this doesn’t mean the absence of people, it means the **absence of purpose**. But God fills us with **kingdom purpose**.
<br>
**CONCLUSION: **
We have a promise from God, we have a saviour called Jesus and we have kingdom purpose.
<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK: **
Remember that God’s love is personal to us: he knows our name, and he sent the Prince of Peace to be our saviour. He has not forgotten us, not forsaken us, and He loves us.
