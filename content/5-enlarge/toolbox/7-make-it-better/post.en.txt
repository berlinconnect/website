**KEY POINTS:**
1. If you work at something, you can always make it better!
2. The thief comes to steal, kill and destroy so we have to be watchful of the things we value and want to keep. 
3. The best way to keep what you have is to work at it.

**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**

In the book of Genesis we see how God created the Garden of Eden. Then in **Genesis 2:15** it says: “**The Lord God took the man (Adam) and put him in the Garden of Eden to tend it and to keep it.**”
To tend means to cultivate, to make better, to develop. God made a perfect garden – and he wants Adam to make it better? Doesn’t that seem impossible?

God doesn’t ask us to do something if he knows we can’t do it. If God tells someone to do something, it reveals the potential in that person. When he gives us instructions, he sees and speaks to the capacity in us. 

We think everything that comes from God is so perfect and that we couldn’t improve on it, but we can always make it better. No matter how beautiful the garden was, if God said to improve it there was room to improve it. In every area of our lives - marriage, ministry, job, business, study - with the Holy Spirit in you, if you work at it you can always make it better. 

**John 10:10 (NIV) “The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.”**
 
Jesus called the devil a thief, but why not a robber? This tells us about the nature of our enemy and how they operate. A thief takes things secretly without using force at all, but in a robbery you are forced to give up what’s yours under threat. A thief takes advantage of someone not paying attention to their belongings, and they might not even realise straight away that what they had is gone. That’s how our enemy works - he can steal our faith and our vision.
 
The thief comes to steal, kill and destroy. 
How can you destroy someone after you have killed him? The word kill here also means to sacrifice. The enemy loves to create situations where you can’t see any other way to solve your problem, other than to sacrifice or surrender what was once so valuable to you. For example, he will make you so busy in your day job that you have no time for your business plans, or creative dreams; he will make you so busy you feel like you don’t have time for church. So you will surrender your great love. 

<br>
**Proverbs 4:23 (NLT) “Guard your heart above all else, for it determines the course of your life.”**

Maybe the word ‘guard’ sounds like something passive or defensive, but the best way to guard your heart is to work it. 
To keep your faith - work it. 
To keep your marriage - work it. 
To stay healthy - work out!
To keep your job - work hard. 
It’s the same with our hearts and our faith -  we have to work on it always, keep it going, keep it active. That’s how you keep what you have.

<br>
**CONCLUSION**
Let’s keep what we have, by working at it and on it. Let’s guard our hearts, our faith and our vision so that we can keep them and even make them better!
