**KEY POINTS:**
1. Be prepared to step into the opportunities the Lord is providing for you.
2. Change your language to a language of responsibility.
3. Adapt the “Can Do” mentality in everything.
4. Shift from the “How-Zone” to the “Why-Zone".
<br>
**When opportunities arise to stretch us, we need to step into them by faith. **
God sees further and quicker than we can in the given moment. We are told to enlarge our lives, and by doing so, we receive opportunities to stretch us and most of the time, it comes in a form of a challenge. However, we need to ask ourselves who are we trusting in - ourselves or the Lord. 
<br>
**A season of growth **
We are currently facing a season of enlarging therefore a new language is needed as we lead the people around us. As we are building a new culture, we need a new language, a language of responsibility. You can always be a guest - a guest is someone who comes in and out, but doesn’t fully get involved. However, to be part of a family - which can be a work family, a church family, group of friends, or at school, you need to truly commit and take responsibility for the growth and health of the family.  
<br>
**Adapt the “Can Do” mentality in everything you do. **
By doing this, you are changing your mindset from lack and limitations to motivation and drive. When you have a vision you then have a discipline. When you know you are loved, you have a motivation to  fulfill this vision in your life. 
<br>
**Shifting from the “How-Zone” to the “Why-Zone” changes your perspective on the world around you.** When you are constantly asking yourself “How is this possible?” “How do I do this?” “How come I am stuck with this responsibility?” you unknowingly put limitations on yourself and approach the situation from a position of lack. However, when we change the question from “How?” to “Why?”, we melt our hearts with the awesomeness and the beauty of what God has done for us. We leave it (our problems, situations, and the "How?") - up to God. 
<br>
**CONCLUSION:**
God is wanting to do amazing things in your life, and the life of the church. He is enlarging our houses and providing us with many opportunities to grow. However, we often approach these opportunities from a place of fear, asking “How can I do this?” or “I just can’t do it!” therefore limiting ourselves and our growth. We must realize that we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us, and step into these opportunities in faith. When we do this, we are stretching out and enlarging our tents.

**THOUGHTS FOR THE WEEK:**
Think about the opportunities that are being presented to you that will definitely challenge you and require a step of faith. These could be in all spheres of your life! God is providing you with an opportunity to grow - leave the details and the “How” up to him, and take the step of faith!
