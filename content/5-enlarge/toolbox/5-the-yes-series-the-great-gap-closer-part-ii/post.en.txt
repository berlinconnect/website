**KEY POINTS:**
1. Don’t be discouraged by the gaps you see in your life: the moments where you feel you don’t measure up, where life overwhelms you.
2. We can’t do anything without Jesus. God is the one who moves in to close the gap.
3. The only thing we can do is simply say ‘yes’ to Jesus in every situation, in every ‘gap’.
 <br>
**Jesus, the great gap-closer: **
- Lost Sheep: It’s the shepherd who closes the gap. We have a Saviour who is willing to carry us all the way home. 
- Two sons and a father: The father runs toward him; he closes the gap. The son only has to say ‘yes’ to his father. 
 <br>   
**CONCLUSION:**
For God so loved the world, that HE closed the gap. He came to us.
God is the great gap-closer. He moves in close to us, the only thing we can do is say yes to Him in every moment of our life.
 <br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK:**
If we bring Jesus into our everyday life, what gaps could he close? Be conscious of Jesus, the greatest gap-closer, and run to Him in every circumstance.
