**KEY POINTS:**
1. When we think we’re not good enough for God, we stand at a distance from him… but the message of Easter is that we are good enough, because of Jesus.
2. Jesus saw the best in people - he saw people created and loved by God, and worth dying for. And so can we, when we put our Jesus filter on!
3. We don’t have to come back and thank God for His amazing grace - but let’s be people who come back because we want to.

**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**

**Luke 17:11-19 (GNT)**
**Jesus Heals Ten Men**
As Jesus made his way to Jerusalem, he went along the border between Samaria and Galilee. He was going into a village when he was met by ten men suffering from a dreaded skin disease. They stood at a distance and shouted, “Jesus! Master! Have pity on us!” Jesus saw them and said to them, “Go and let the priests examine you.”
On the way they were made clean. When one of them saw that he was healed, he came back, praising God in a loud voice. He threw himself to the ground at Jesus' feet and thanked him. The man was a Samaritan. Jesus spoke up, “There were ten who were healed; where are the other nine? Why is this foreigner the only one who came back to give thanks to God?” And Jesus said to him, “Get up and go; your faith has made you well.”

…

**The spirit of distance**

At this time, people suffering with leprosy were cast out from the community. It was believed they were being punished by God. This is why the men “**stood at a distance**” when Jesus arrived. The **spirit of distance** seizes us when we feel we’ve done wrong and we’re **not good enough for God**. It’s tempting to stand at a distance when we haven’t got our life together.

But the message of Easter is that through Jesus, **we are good enough.**

Church is full of people who haven’t got their acts together! There’s good, bad and ugly, but we know **He is faithful** and we can’t do this in our own strength. Society taught the lepers they should stand at a distance. But let’s not let anyone talk us out of **being in the presence of God.**
<br>
**Get your Jesus filter on **

At the time, lepers couldn’t return to society until they showed themselves to the priest, who would decide if they were clean. When Jesus told the men to “**Go and let the priests examine you,” he was saying “let others see what I see.”**

And what did Jesus see when he looked at the men? He saw healing and wholeness - a **person**, not a disease or behaviour. Jesus didn’t see faults and differences - he just saw the people he **created, loved** and was **going to die for.** 

If we look at each other **without God,** we see the flaws, behaviours, and differences. We see **the worst, not the best.** So let’s learn to do it God’s way - and get our **Jesus filter** on!
<br>
**“On the way they were made clean”**

But when it came to healing the men, Jesus said “**get up and go**,” not “**sit down and stay**.” 

The men went, and “**on the way they were made clean**”. They had to keep moving. Likewise, we’ve got to **commit to the journey** - there’s no-one else who can forgive us and love us like God does. Jesus doesn’t shrink us, he **enlarges us** - but we’ve got to be ready to surrender to him.
<br>
**Matthew 16:25 (NIV)**
For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it
<br>
**The foreigner who came back**

A Samaritan was **an outsider**, loathed by Jewish communities. But the good news is that **we are all qualified** for God’s grace and his amazing love. There’s **no-one** He cannot lift and strengthen. The Samaritan realised what God’s grace had done for him when everyone else had rejected him.

But Jesus never said “**...and then come back and thank me.**” We can freely choose whether to come back - but the Samaritan **wanted** to thank Jesus when he realised he was healed, delivered and set free.

We don’t **have** to thank God for his grace and love. But let’s be people who come back and say thank you because we **want** to. Jesus wants to **see us, heal us and fix us** when we’re broken and hurting. He took everything that’s wrong with us and gave everything that’s right with him to our account. 

We got **freedom** when we should have been **condemned**. 
He was **broken** so we could be **healed**. 
Our salvation is **free**, but it **cost him his life**.
…
<br>
**CONCLUSION:**
This is the **greatest message** the world has: that we have a saviour who **sees us as people**, and loves us for **who we are, not what we do**. He opened the door to salvation and welcomed us in.

If we get lost, it’s about **getting back to the cross** and this message. When we see His grace, he will **always** see our faith.
<br>

**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK:**
We can come to Jesus just as we are, like the lepers could. But let’s remind ourselves to be people who **come back and thank God** for his grace and love - not because he told us to but because **we want to**.
