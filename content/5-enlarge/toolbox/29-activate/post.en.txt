**KEY POINTS:**
1. 2016 is a year to **ACTIVATE** what God has placed in our lives
2. To activate God’s ways, we have to **DECLARE** them: this is voice activation!
3. Jesus **spoke life** into situations: this is something we can do, too.
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**
To make God’s words become a reality, we’ve got to do our part, and start to **activate** his ways. It’s a **partnership** - a co-mission - and we are **co-labourers**. 
<br>
**What does “ACTIVATE” mean?**
It means to set in motion, to organise and create.
 
We’ve got one life to live. Let’s create the atmosphere, and speak it over our lives. In difficult situations, it’s about thinking: “**How am I going to shape this, and start to move it in a different way?**”
 
When we voice activate, we start to **create, shape and form** our world. God has placed in our lives everything we need, but it’s our job to declare it - to **voice activate it**.
...
<br>
**What does it mean, to DECLARE?**
It means: to say, to speak, to tell, and to command.
 
**To SAY** means to quote what has been said. It’s about thinking: “**I’m gonna learn what God says, and line up with it.**” Even in moments of temptation, and time when we don’t understand, let’s learn to **speak the promise of God**. Let’s learn God’s word and **speak it into reality**. God works all things out for the good of those who love him.
 
**To SPEAK** means to communicate - and to start to talk God’s word into our world. This is when we begin **speaking life into things**: into our career, family, friendships, and those we meet.
 
**To TELL** means to **testify** of what has happened and is happening in our lives. And this isn’t just about massive miracles – God is at work in all of our lives. He’s for us. Let’s look back at certain moments where we wonder “**how did that happen?**” and realise that God was there! And then we can testify: “**God saved me in that moment!**”
 
**To COMMAND** means to speak with order and authority, and to give direction. We’re the captain of our ship. It’s about asking: “**what does God say to ME about how to shape MY world?**” Sometimes we need to learn to **take command**, and speak out when we don’t accept things. It’s about learning how to stand and have authority, how to speak into the **storms of life** and say “**be still.**”
<br>

**Psalm 50:6 (ESV)**
The heavens declare his righteousness,
<br>
**Psalm 145: 4 (ESV)**
 One generation shall commend your works to another, and shall declare your mighty acts.
 <br>
**Hillsong United, “Rule”:** “Be the crown in the light and sound, be the fire burning inside out, be the love casting out all fear, let your name rule the atmosphere.”
...
 <br>
**What are we going to speak into our world this year?**
 
**Proverbs 18:21 (ESV)**
Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruits.

We want to **speak life** into situations.
 
Too many people in the world are **thermometers**: they just **read** the temperature and the situation where they are. Let’s not be a thermometer: let’s be a **thermostat**. Let’s be people who can set the tone, raise the temperature and cool things down. People who can say to others: “**Don’t let that get too big for you**” and “**God’s got plans, just keep walking through that.**”  Let’s not just go with the flow: instead, let’s learn the **power of voice activation** in our own lives!
<br>
Let’s learn to **lift our lives** to where God is, rather than **bringing his words down** to our level.
<br>
**Acts 16:25 (ESV), The Philippian Jailer Converted **
About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them,

Paul and Silas were in prison: they were trapped, chained up in a **dark place** and unable to go anywhere. But they learned to praise God, and **speak it**, even though it seemed completely countercultural, and **at odds with their situation** - and it changed everything! This is the power of God.
<br>
When we’re in a **dark place**, we can say: ”**Jesus is my light,**”
When we’re in a **hurt place**, we can say: “**Jesus is my hero,**”
When we’re **alone**, we can say: “**Jesus is my friend,**”
And when we have **no hope**, we can say: “**Jesus is my hope.**”
 <br>
God knew the power of words.

**Genesis 1:3 (ESV)**
And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.
<br>
**What to declare?**

Our **prayers** are a declaration – when we pray, we’re **speaking God’s ways**, and **declaring** them into the atmosphere.

But let’s be **specific** with our words. It’s about declaring the things we **want to see** in our lives - and not using words to put ourselves in a prison, saying things like: “**I’m not good enough.**” Let’s break through that, so we can **activate** all God wants to do in our lives.

The enemy wants to **speak lies** into our lives and **deactivate** what God wants to activate. We’ve got to stay alert. On the other hand… we sometimes activate things before they should be. We’ve got to learn to navigate this, so we can have **God’s timing** over our lives.

**John 11: 38-44 (ESV): Jesus Raises Lazarus**
**38** Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it. **39** Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, “Lord, by this time there will be an odor, for he has been dead four days.” **40** Jesus said to her, “Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?” **41** So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, “Father, I thank you that you have heard me. **42** I knew that you always hear me, but I said this on account of the people standing around, that they may believe that you sent me.” **43** When he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out.” **44** The man who had died came out, his hands and feet bound with linen strips, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, “Unbind him, and let him go.”
What does he say? He’s specific – he says “Lazarus, come out.”
 
Jesus speaks things into the atmosphere, and declares the kingdom of heaven. He speaks life into things that are dead.
 <br>
**CONCLUSION: **
God has placed in our lives everything we need. Now it’s up to us to declare his ways, speak life into things, and activate it all!
<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK: **
What are we going to activate in our lives in 2016? What are we going to determine that God wants to activate in our lives?
