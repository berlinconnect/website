**KEY POINTS:**
1. The vision is about knowing Jesus, and making him known.
2. We are all the church, and we all have our own unique part to play in adding value to our spheres of influence and our city.
3. God is speaking to us every day. Our mission is to listen to Him, and be what He has called us to be.

<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**
<br>
**What is the vision?**

To **reposition** Jesus & His Church in the minds of secular Europe by building a large, **Christ-centred** bible-based church in the heart of Berlin, **changing mindsets** and **empowering people** to lead and impact in every sphere of life.
 
The vision is full of opportunity - it’s big enough for everyone in the church. Our God is a solution-orientated God. The story of Berlin has always been a story of division - but Jesus **unites us** through his love for us and his mercy towards us. Church is about bringing an **answer** to a chaotic world. Let’s make a commitment to **know** which part we play, **find a way** to play it, and bring **God’s story** to the centre of the storm!

<br>
**Stones, not bricks**

**Genesis 11:3 (MSG) - Building the Tower of Babel.**
“They said to one another, “Come, let’s make bricks and fire them well.” They used brick for stone and tar for mortar.”

The tower of babel was an attempt by humans to be like God. The people want to remain together, as one - but later in **Genesis 11**, God scatters them across the world, causing diversity in language and culture. **Why?** Because God wants to bring out the **best** in us, not the worst.

God uses **community** to shape us in a positive way. This can sometimes be challenging, as it means working alongside people who are different to us. But in a community of **“me”**, how can we grow? God never wanted us to be bricks, he wanted us to be **stones**. 

Bricks are **man-made**, stones are **God-made**.
Bricks are **the same (one size fits all)**, stones are **unique (one size fits ONE)**.

So let’s build a church not with bricks, but with **stones**. God knows the good, bad and the ugly in all of us - but when we go to God, we don’t go directly as us. We go through Jesus! In fact, we can ONLY go **through Jesus**, because he lived the life we could never live.

<br>
**On a mission – all week long**

**Psalm 27:4 (NIV)** “One thing I ask from the Lord, this only do I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.”

In church on Sundays, we are a gathering of people with an unfinished story. On Mondays we go back into our own spheres of influence. This is where we can think: “**How can I be what God’s called me to be?**” and “**How can I add value to the city?**”
 
**Romans 12:1 (MSG)** “So here’s what I want you to do, God helping you: Take your everyday, ordinary life – your sleeping, eating, going-to-work, and walking-around life – and place it before God as an offering.”
 
We’re all **on a mission** in our weekly lives. We don’t have to be “evangelists” – we just have to be ourselves, shine brightly and have a **story** to tell people! Every day is an opportunity to really **shine brightly for Jesus**. It’s about saying: “**Hey God, use me**!” and he will –  in ways we can’t even imagine. 

<br>
**It’s about KNOWING JESUS and MAKING HIM KNOWN**

It’s so simple, but when we do it, we are **all** the church. Let’s bring leadership and vision, and play a part in making Berlin a **future-minded city**. 

**How?** By adding value to people, and **empowering people to lead** in every sphere of life. By **serving, not demanding**, and working with a **spirit of grace**. By going back into the marketplace with the **generous spirit of Jesus**.

We live **FROM** love, not **FOR** love. It’s about not pulling people down to make ourselves look good – but **lifting other people up**! Generosity and hospitality is always what our church is about. Let’s speak well of people, compliment people, and see the **person, not the belief**.

<br>
**Hearing God’s voice**
**Luke 10:38 (MSG) **
“As they continued their travel, Jesus entered a village. A woman by the name of Martha welcomed him and made him feel quite at home. She had a sister, Mary, who sat before the Master, hanging on every word he said. But Martha was pulled away by all she had to do in the kitchen.”

We’ve all got to learn **to hear God’s voice**. He is speaking to us every day, giving us answers. Let’s learn to connect the dots, and see how our God is speaking to us.

<br>
**CONCLUSION: **
Our vision is to change people’s perception of Jesus and his church. We’re committed to moving forward, being what God has called us to be and empowering people to bring God values to the marketplace, and the whole city.
<br>

**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK: **
Ask yourself: How is God speaking to me - and am I listening to Him? What’s the ONE THING I’ve learned on Sunday? Let’s believe in what we’re doing, make the vision OUR vision, and **hear God’s voice** over our lives this year like we never have before.
