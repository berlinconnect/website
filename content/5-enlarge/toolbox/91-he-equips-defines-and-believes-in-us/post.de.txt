**Johannes: “He equips us”**

**JUDGE 6:12-16 (NIV)**
12 When the angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon, he said, “The Lord is with you, mighty warrior.” 13 “Pardon me, my lord,” Gideon replied, “but if the Lord is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our ancestors told us about when they said, ‘Did not the Lord bring us up out of Egypt?’ But now the Lord has abandoned us and given us into the hand of Midian.” 14 The Lord turned to him and said, “Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian’s hand. Am I not sending you?” 15 “Pardon me, my lord,” Gideon replied, “but how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family.” 16 The Lord answered, “I will be with you, and you will strike down all the Midianites, leaving none alive.”

Sometimes we are completely overwhelmed by the task God has placed before us and we, therefore, ask God - “But how can I do this?” “Why me?!” as there is a disconnect between what God sees in us and what we see in ourselves. When we feel overwhelmed we are in great company if we look to the different characters in the bible! Remind yourself that there is something God sees in you, that you just can’t see, yet. Feel comforted in knowing that He has fully equipped us with everything needed to fulfill His plan.

**Susi - “He believes in us”**

**JEREMIAH 1:6-8 (NIV)**
6 “Alas, Sovereign Lord,” I said, “I do not know how to speak; I am too young.” 7 But the Lord said to me, “Do not say, ‘I am too young.’ You must go to everyone I send you to and say whatever I command you. 8 Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you and will rescue you,” declares the Lord.

What does God say about the current season you are in? Or the certain obstacle or situation you are facing? It is easy to feel that you just can not do it, however, you can! God believes in you! It isn’t about our strength and how we are, but rather what God can do through us. Believe in yourself as God believes in you, and you can take on those mountains!

**Izzy: “He gives us strength”**

**EPHESIANS 3:18-20 (ESV)**
18 (I pray that you) may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, 19 and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. 20 Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us,

Because of our past experiences, it is easy to develop a false sense of strength, where we are tough on the exterior and tend to hold people far away to “protect” ourselves. When we place our identity in Christ, we develop an inner strength that can only come from God. God will then enlarge our lives and give us opportunities to expand our life, where we need a strength that we get only get from God to do the things God has asked us to do. When you come to God and admit that we can’t do it without his strength - He is faithful to pouring this strength into you.

**Robert: “ He defines us”**

**ESPHESIANS 2:10 (NIV)**
10 For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.

Ask yourself - “What is defining who you are?”  Is it the job, the degree, the material things you have (cellphone, clothing), or your past experiences?  If so, what are these things doing if we let them define who we are? If often makes us come across superior and arrogant. However, if we define ourselves by the acceptance and love of Jesus Christ, our Saviour and put our identity in Him, we in turn lift other people.

**Conclusion:**
Regardless of our current season, God believes in us and is cheering us on! Whenever you feel overwhelmed to do the task that is placed before you, remember that God has already equipped you with the tools and character to complete the task! He gives you the strength that is needed!

**Thoughts for your week:**
Are there things your life you are worried about? Do you feel slightly overwhelmed by all the tasks that you have to do? Ask God to reveal Himself to you and provide you with the strength to accomplish that which He has asked you to do! Remember that when you don’t believe in yourself, you aren’t doing in your strength, but you are doing it through Him, in His strength. Your Heavenly Father believes in you.
