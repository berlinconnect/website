**KEY POINTS:**

1. God uses tests to **shape our character**: just like He did with Joseph
2. We’re here to **add value to the world**, and God’s tests allow us to do that
3. When we pass God’s tests and enlarge our lives, it’s **not just us who benefit**!
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**

**Pass the test: Joseph**

Joseph went through lots of tests during his life.
<br>
**The TEST OF TIME**

At 17 he worked faithfully in his father’s field, taking responsibility. His brothers sold him into slavery, and in Potipher’s house he **kept on serving and taking responsibility.** Mistreated and forgotten when he had done everything right, one thing that stayed consistent was his serving character. He **passed the test of time**.
<br>
**The TEST OF INTEGRITY**

In Potipher’s house, Joseph wasn’t tempted by Potipher’s wife: he passed the test of integrity. 
But he was wrongly accused and thrown in prison… and still he served! That’s what God’s people do. You can’t keep a good man down. 
<br>
**The TEST OF ADVERSITY **

If we throw a basketball with no air in to the floor, it stays there. But with air in, it **bounces back up** again. When things don’t go our way and we hit the ground, do we bounce back? This is the **test of adversity**. 

It’s unhealthy to build relationships based on things always going our way, meaning we run at the first hiccup. Let’s wake up and realise that **God wants us to pass the test**! If we always got our way, and had every prayer answered, we wouldn’t become better people. God uses the tests of life to **shape our character**, just like he did with Joseph.
<br>
**Passing God’s tests**

Joseph got a call from Pharaoh because he’d continually **proved himself** over the years. After 13 years of passing God’s tests, he spent 70+ years walking in the **fruit of his faithfulness**.

Let’s run from temptation, but pass God’s tests. All the tests are for our development: God wants to take us where we can’t take us, and He’s there waiting for us to pass. So if something’s stretching us, let’s **embrace the stretch** - it’ll change our lives.
<br>

**CONCLUSION:**

Like Joseph, we’ll all find ourselves working under someone, and facing tests - but we’re not here to live comfortable, luxurious lives: we’re here to **serve and add value** to the world. If we build life around pleasure, we’re making it **all about us**. 

Let’s learn to take responsibility in our 20s to set up our 30s and 40s and enlarge our lives. Let’s not take what God has made big, and make it small. 

<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK:**

When we pass God’s tests, it’s **not just us who benefit**. Through passing the tests and serving over the years, Joseph was in a position to **bring solutions and healing to a whole nation**. How many of us today could bring solutions to our world, and improve the lives of people? We won’t know until we take responsibility and pass God’s tests.
