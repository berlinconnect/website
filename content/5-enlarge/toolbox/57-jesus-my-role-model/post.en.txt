**Key Points: **
1. We all need role models in our life. But if we only look to people, we will inevitably be disappointed because people are not perfect.
2. Jesus can be our only and best role model. He lived a sinless and perfect life making servanthood his focus.
3. With Jesus as our role model, we can navigate all challenges in our lifes and build relationships, families, and homes that honour God.
<br>
**Key Scriptures + Concepts:**
**Philippians 2:11 NIV**
Therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion,2 then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind. 3 Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, 4 not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others. 5 In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: 6 Who, being in very nature[a] God,did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; 7 rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature[b] of a servant, being made in human likeness.8 And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death - even death on a cross! 9 Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, 10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,in heaven and on earth and under the earth, 11 and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

**An example we can follow**
How do we do relationships well? We all need a good role model - Jesus and our relationship to Him can be exactly that.
<br>
**The importance of role models**
All of us need good role models. Human role model will fail and disappoint. But Jesus stands alone. Jesus lived a perfect and sinless life.
<br>
**Jesus as a role model**
Jesus humbled himself. He talked to humble and proud people, to religious and the non-religious. Humility is right identity, pride is wrong identity. When you know who you are you will always gravitate towards people who know who they are.
If we can let Jesus be the role model, by His grace something of Him will rub off on us.
<br>
**Jesus modeled servanthood**
Jesus didn’t come to command, He came to serve. He is the greatest example of servanthood.
<br>
**Jesus modeled focus**
Jesus was a great role model of focus.
He was always focused on the heart of the father and on people.
<br>
**Relationships**
Relationships are a challenge, because we are all so different.
We need help when it comes to human relationships. We need God in our life to build the homes, marriages and lives that honour God.
<br>
**Conclusion:**
God sees you. He doesn’t just see you, he knows you. He also knows our mess and the challenges we face. Let’s never be scared to tell our story. If God is in it, it’s unfinished.
<br>
**Thoughts for your week: **
How can you model servanthood to the people in your life this week?
