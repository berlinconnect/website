**KEY POINTS:**
1. God uses **tests** to help us grow.They are not for God: they are for us!
2. There are different tests we’ll encounter on our journey, which will help us **learn more about God’s faithfulness**.
3. It’s all about taking responsibility, and thinking in **decades, not days**.
<br>

**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**

**PASS THE TEST**
<br>
**James 1:12 (NLV)**
The man who does not give up when tests come is happy. After the test is over, he will receive the crown of life. God has promised this to those who love Him.
**Ephesians 5:15 (PHILLIPS)**
Live life, then, with a due sense of responsibility, not as men who do not know the meaning and purpose of life but as those who do. 
...
<br>
A test is not a temptation. Temptation is what we want and gravitate towards, whereas tests are **what God wants to use** to shape our character and grow our lives. There’s a PURPOSE to a test. God will never tempt us, but he will allow us to go through tests. 
<br>
**These are the 10 tests that develop our potential**

1. The test of **small things**
2. The **motivation** test
3. The **credibility** test
4. The **time** test
5. The **authority** test
6. The **adversity** test
7. The **offence** test
8. The **failure** test
9. The **success** test
10. The **Lordship** test

....more on these in the coming weeks!
<br>
Jesus already passed the ultimate test, which **no-one** could have passed except him. He didn’t just bring about forgiveness: he **justifies** us. Justification means it’s like the crime was never committed. So we already have a “**sehr gut**” stamp when we go to God!
<br>
**So why do we need to go through tests?**

Through tests we’ll find out more about **God’s character** towards us, we’ll discover his **faithfulness** and we’ll know **he’s with us**. There’s more to learn about Jesus than we could ever imagine! **It’s like praying**: we don’t pray because God needs our prayers: he already knows everything. We pray for ourselves! To get it out of our system, and to call upon His name.

**How to arrive happy in your 40s**

Often, we **overestimate** what we can do in **one year**, but **underestimate** what we can do in ten. We think in days, when God wants us to **think in decades**. 

Can we do the season of time well? Let’s not underestimate what God can do with our lives in a decade.

Making healthy choices in our 20s >** Not shrinking life** in our 30s > 
**being happy & liftling others** in our 40s

Our world is supposed to get **bigger, not smaller**. The big things are blessings, but we often try to shrink them so we can handle them. If we take responsibility when we’re younger, it’ll be easier for us to handle these bigger blessings (marriage, children, etc) - and we won’t have to shrink our lives down.
...
<br>
**CONCLUSION: **
If we live **God’s way**, we’ll be amazed… but if we shrink His plans for us down to human ways of thinking, we’ll always find limitations. So let’s **take the tests** God places before us, take **responsibility** when He offers it to us, and **enlarge our lives, not shrink them**.

<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK:**
What **test** is God placing before us right now? And how can we take responsibility and **face this test**, so we can learn more about His grace and faithfulness? God wants to enlarge our lives - and we can work with Him on that!
