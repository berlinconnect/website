**KEY POINTS:**
1. Heaven is sometimes silent, but that doesn’t mean God doesn’t hear us.
2. When God doesn’t answer our prayers like we expect, it’s because he has a bigger plan for us - something we CAN’T expect, or even imagine.
3. Sometimes we have to serve in silence - but when we serve God, we are preparing ourselves for the destiny he has in store for us.

**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**

**Hebrews 5:7 (ESV)**
In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence.

**Matthew 27:46 (NLT)**
At about three o’clock, Jesus called out with a loud voice, “Eli, Eli,lema sabachthani?” which means “My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?”

This is the only time Jesus refers to his father as God – at that moment he was being cut off from his Father. But heaven remained silent. And why? Not because God didn’t hear him - but because God had a **bigger plan** than rescuing his son from death

We may go through seasons when heaven is silent, but we will never go through seasons when our prayers are unheard.

Heaven may be silent... but it is **never deaf**. When heaven is silent, and we can’t understand why God doesn’t say something, it means God is working out something for us that is bigger than we can imagine. **God is doing his best in our worst**. And when He sometimes doesn’t meet our expectations... it’s because he wants to **exceed them**!
 
When Lazarus was sick (John 11) Jesus didn’t just turn up when things were **difficult** (healing him) - he waited until things were **impossible** (raising Lazarus from the dead!)
God had something bigger, better and **more wonderful** to show Mary and Martha. It was easy for the women to imagine Jesus healing Lazarus… but it was **impossible** to imagine Jesus raising him from the dead!

Let’s not get annoyed with God because he doesn’t turn up when we want, or answer prayers like we expect. Let’s **raise the bar** - because we **can’t imagine** how God will answer our prayer! What he has in store for us is going to **blow our minds**! Human imagination is not even close to what God can do.
 
There are seasons in life when God seems to hide himself. But it’s not because he’s angry - it’s because he wants us to know him on a **deeper level**, and discover him in the most unlikely places Let’s begin to listen for God in the **most unlikely places**, as he speaks to us through the **most unlikely people**. We can trust that He is working for our good at the **most unlikely times**.

When Mary and Joseph stood at the door of the inn before the birth of Jesus, the innkeeper missed an opportunity to serve the King of Kings, as Jesus stood at the door **hidden in Mary’s womb**. Very often, God hides himself in opportunities to serve that seem to upset our social calendars, and mess with life - but He’s setting us up for something!
 
In **Genesis 24**, Rebekah spent around 6 hours bringing water to camels for a servant, who was **testing her** to see if she would make a suitable wife for Isaac.

Rebekah was totally unaware she was being set up. She didn’t know that heaven’s gaze was **on her for promotion**. She had no idea she was standing before an **open door of destiny**, disguised as ten thirsty camels. The door to her destiny as Isaac’s bride was not her beauty or morality, it was her **servanthood**.

**Genesis 24:21  (NLT)**
The servant watched her in silence, wondering whether or not the Lord had given him success in his mission.
Very often God watches in silence, giving us no applause, no recognition, and no appreciation. But he had bigger things in mind for Rebekah.
 
**Genesis 24:61 (NLT)**
Then Rebekah and her servant girls mounted the camels and followed the man. So Abraham’s servant took Rebekah and went on his way.

Rebekah rode on the very thing she served! The thing she served was the transportation into the destiny God had for her.

**CONCLUSION: **
Heaven may be silent when we serve...  but what we serve is our **transport into our next season** God has in store for us. Let’s not be disheartened when it seems like heaven is silent. God is **never deaf to our prayers**, and when He doesn’t answer them as we expect, it’s because He has something bigger in mind.
If we can expect something, and imagine it… it’s not God. But when things happen that we could **NEVER** have imagined, that’s when God is at work.

**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK: **
Why do we serve? Is it because we want to **feel good**, and receive applause and recognition… or do we want to prepare ourselves for God, and His plans for us?
