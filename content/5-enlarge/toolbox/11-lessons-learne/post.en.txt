**KEY POINTS:**
1. Everything comes back to our relationship with Jesus
2. When we face challenges, we can take the pressure off ourselves and put it on Him, because He can do more than we can even imagine.
3. But we have to choose to accept Jesus, and to have a relationship with him.
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**
<br>
**Philipp**
Moving forward means being proactive about the things we already know, and the things learned in church. It’s about thinking: “**What am I going to do about what I’ve heard today? And how will I apply it in my life?**”
But at the same time, it’s about knowing we can rest in Jesus. Through Him we have the strength and the resources we need.
Let's not always expect the least we can do, but have an attitude to always expect **more than we can imagine**.
There's always something more than the best version of “**you**” that you can imagine right now. 
Your life is a story of God, and it will **blow your mind**.
<br>
**Robert**
I have learned to give my challenges over to Jesus, and put the pressure on Him.
When facing challenges, I learned to tell myself: “**Robert, you can do this. Not because of your own strength but because of Jesus’s strength.**” It made me look forward to the challenges coming up.
Being pushed out of our comfort zone is good, because we can learn so much from challenges. But we can always know the pressure is not on us: it’s on Jesus.
During one challenge, we as a team surrendered to Him and cried: “**Jesus, it’s on you now. We can’t do this on our own.**” 
And even if we make mistakes, what counts is that we're **bringing our hearts, not just our skills**.

**Sheila**
**Everything** comes back to my relationship with Jesus. This relationship shapes me, and makes me who I am. Out of this relationship I can say ‘yes’ to challenges, because I want to **enlarge my life**, and keep growing.
But I know that it’s **all because of Him**. He’s giving me all this strength, and everything I need to do this.
<br>
**Callista**
I have learned the importance of **making the right decisions**. In my case, that meant coming to church every Sunday, being part of the youth team, and other choices I’ve made.
We don’t lose out on anything by making the right decisions: we **open doors**.
<br>

**CONCLUSION: **
When we face challenges in life, we know we can count on Jesus. If we surrender to Him, we will find that He provides all the strength and resources we need. We can’t always rely on our own strength, our own skills or even our own imagination – but when we have a relationship with Jesus, we can ALWAYS rely on Him.

**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK: **
What have you learned in 2015? Let’s keep choosing Jesus, keep looking to Him for our strength, and keep reflecting on how we can apply the things He teaches us.
