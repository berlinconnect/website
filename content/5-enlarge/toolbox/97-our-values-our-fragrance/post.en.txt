**Key Points:**
1. Values create a sweet fragrance of God’s presence and are key in building our future as a church.
2. Let’s build a church with a fragrance where Jesus is lifted up and which attracts lost sons and daughters, welcoming them home.
3. Being aware of what God has done for us (saving us and keeping us by His grace) and living our lives with Christ at the centre creates a sweet fragrance.

**Key Scriptures + Concepts: **
**John 12:1-9 NLV**
It was six days before the special religious gathering to remember how the Jews left Egypt. Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus lived. Jesus had raised Lazarus from the dead. 2 They made supper for Him. Martha put the food on the table. Lazarus was at the table with Him. 3 **Mary took a jar of special perfume that cost much money and poured it on the feet of Jesus.** She dried His feet with her hair. **The house was filled with the smell of the special perfume.** 4 Judas Iscariot was one of the followers. He was about to hand Jesus over to the leaders of the country. He said, 5 “Why was not this special perfume sold for much money and given to poor people?” 6 He did not say this because he cared for poor people. He said this because he was a robber. He carried the bag of money and would steal some of it for himself. 7 Jesus said, “Let her alone. She has kept it for the time when I will be buried. 8 You will always have poor people with you. You will not always have Me.”
<br>
Mary was aware of what Jesus had done for her and expressed her thankfulness by pouring out expensive perfume, thus creating a sweet fragrance. Through staying connected to Jesus, putting Him at the centre of our lives, aligning our lives with His plan and taking on His attitude, we, too, can create a fragrance that lifts up the name of Jesus and is attractive to people.
<br>
Some of our key values that create a sweet fragrance unto God:
- Servanthood (vs. self focus) - Serving the Lord with gladness (Ps 100:2)
- The cause of Christ (vs. entitlement)
- Excellence (vs. mediocrity)
- Submission (vs. independence)
- Generosity (vs. smallness)
<br>
**Conclusion:**
Sharing the same values helps create a fragrance that invites people in.

**Thoughts for your week: **
What can you do to contribute to building a fragrance of God’s presence in God’s house and the area of society you find yourself in?
