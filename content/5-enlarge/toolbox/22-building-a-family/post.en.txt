**KEY POINTS:**
1. The early church is the best example of what a church family looks like.
2. Family eats together.
3. Family does life together.
4. What holds us together is the Holy Spirit.
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**

**Acts 2:42 NLT**
All the believers devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching, and to fellowship, and to sharing in meals (including the Lord’s Supper), and to prayer.

Acts 2:42 describes the early church and gives us a picture of what a church family looks like: they ate together, prayed together, were devoted to teaching and spent time together – they made room in their lives for each other. They shared their things, their wealth, their homes, and they had communion and celebrations together. 
We desire for the Church to be an oasis where people from all backgrounds and pasts can come, be refreshed and restored, and where guests become family. We all play a vital part in making new people feel at home.

What builds family? 

**Family eats together. **
These days so many people eat alone, not always because they want to but because they don’t have anyone to eat with. Healthy families eat together - spiritual food and physical food - so why not invite someone to your table?

**Family does life together. **
Healthy families do life together – going to appointments together, helping each other move house, sending cards and flowers or cooking for each other when we’re sick. In family you can be yourself, even if you’re grumpy, say the wrong thing or if you’re having a tough time. Family is safe. We accept each other, love and encourage each other. Let us be a church that can handle the real deal. Healthy families possess what the world longs for. 

**The cement that holds us together is the Holy Spirit. **
The Holy Spirit is not there to make you weird, but useful. The Holy Spirit’s number one job is to let you know you belong in God’s family. The Holy Spirit reminds you who you are – a child of God, legally adopted into his household, a son or daughter of the king. 
<br>

**CONCLUSION: **
Let us go on a journey where we build a real family with everyone contributing. Every member is needed to make the family work. By making room in our lives and taking care of people – especially those who just recently came – we allow heaven to trust us and keep adding to its family. What an honour and a privilege.
