**KEY POINTS:**
1. God wants to **grow His family**, and add to us.
2. We have a God-given assignment: to be **planters and waterers**. But it’s God who brings the increase, not us.
3. Our only way to God is **through Jesus**. We can’t do anything without Jesus - but we can absolutely depend on him.
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**

When we look back down the corridor of our lives, looking at what we gave them to, will we be happy with the decisions we made? Every day we make choices for our future, and it starts today: so let’s **make decisions out of vision**! In our world, life is often more about **pleasure** than purpose. But living for pleasure means we **fall apart** when things go wrong.

Disaster **forces** us to make decisions,
Status Quo **avoids** making decisions,
But vision **loves** making decisions!

<br>
**God brings the increase**
 <br>
**Acts 2:44-47 (MSG)**
And all the believers lived in a wonderful harmony, holding everything in common. They sold whatever they owned and pooled their resources so that each person’s need was met.They followed a daily discipline of worship in the Temple followed by meals at home, every meal a celebration, exuberant and joyful, as they praised God. People in general liked what they saw. Every day their number grew as **God added those who were saved.**
God wants to **add to his family**. Church isn’t the institution, it’s **the people** called out of darkness. We are the church when we gather in His name.
 <br>
**1 Corinthians 3:4-9 (NLT)**
When one of you says, “I am a follower of Paul,” and another says, “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you acting just like people of the world? After all, who is Apollos? Who is Paul? **We are only God’s servants** through whom you believed the Good News. Each of us did the work the Lord gave us.I planted the seed in your hearts, and Apollos watered it, but it was God who made it grow. It’s not important who does the planting, or who does the watering. **What’s important is that God makes the seed grow**. The one who plants and the one who waters work together with the same purpose. And both will be rewarded for their own hard work. For we are both **God’s workers**. And you are God’s field. You are God’s building.
As our community moves forward, God wants to use **all of us**. When we plant and water, we’re doing menial servant jobs – but what makes them worth doing is **the God we are serving.**
 <br>
**Romans 12:1 (MSG)**
So here’s what I want you to do, God helping you: Take your everyday, ordinary life—your sleeping, eating, going-to-work, and walking-around life—and place it before God as an offering. 

If we just say “**God, here I am**,” He will use us! It’s not a case of: “**I have to**” but “**I want to, because I know my God-given assignment.**” God wants to work through our everyday lives. 

<br>
**SHARING CHRIST WITH PEOPLE FROM OUR EVERYDAY LIFE**

Here are some practical things we can do:
 
1. Just let people know in a casual way that we go to church.
2. Ask friends spiritual questions and just listen, not correct them.
3. Be there when people have problems, offer prayer and support.
4. Be open and share challenges but add that our faith helps.
5. Share a book.
6. Share our stories.
7. Include people in personal celebrations, birthdays and hangouts.
8. Bring them to parties or other social events.
9. Bring people to dinner parties.
10. Bring people to Sunday celebrations.
11. If they come because of us, they’re more likely to stay because of us.
12. Be involved, connected and contributing.

**Jesus is our filter**
<br>
**Matthew 17:1-8 (NLT)**
Six days later Jesus took Peter and the two brothers, James and John, and led them up a high mountain to be alone. As the men watched, Jesus’ appearance was transformed so that his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light. Suddenly, **Moses and Elijah** appeared and began talking with Jesus. Peter exclaimed, “Lord, it’s wonderful for us to be here! If you want, I’ll make three shelters as memorials - one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” But even as he spoke, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, “**This is my dearly loved Son, who brings me great joy. Listen to him.**” The disciples were terrified and fell face down on the ground. Then Jesus came over and touched them. “Get up,” he said. “Don’t be afraid.” And when they looked up, Moses and Elijah were gone, and **they saw only Jesus.**

God used to speak to the world through other mediums, but now he speaks **through His son**. It’s **Jesus alone** who saves us. That’s where our hope and encouragement is. We can trust him with our aspirations, failures, insecurities, and **absolutely depend on him** from start to finish. We can’t do anything without Jesus. 

We see the world not as it is, but as we are. We **filter** it. But what if we make **Jesus our filter**?
Let’s not go to God through our own filter (our earthly experience.) Let’s **go through Jesus**. How does Jesus see the Father? And how does He see Jesus? **Perfect**.
<br>
**CONCLUSION:**
We are all on a God-given assignment to plant and to water, but we can’t save anybody, not even ourselves: **we need Him every step of the way**. And we can go to Him through Jesus.
<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK:**
Are the practical steps above something we can adopt in our own lives? Are there people we can share our stories with, bring to dinner parties, listen to, pray for and support? Let’s be **planters and waterers** - and trust God to bring the increase.
