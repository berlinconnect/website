**KEY POINTS:**
1. Christmas will be surrounded by controversy - it means that there is something worth paying attention to.
2.Christmas is full of traditions, religious and secular - the key is not to make the traditions bigger than the message of Jesus.
3. Christmas is always about bringing hope to the hopeless.
<br>
Christ is God’s ultimate miracle and wisdom all wrapped up in one.
Christmas reminds us that the impossible is possible: Up until Jesus no one had access to God’s presence.
The birth of Jesus - Emmanuel “God is with us” - has given us access to God’s presence.
The message of Christmas is that he will never give up on us. 
Christmas will always point to Easter. He was born to die, because he was the perfect sacrifice. He died for us and closed the gap for us. He became sin, so we could become righteous. 
<br>
**CONCLUSION: **
If Jesus was born, lived, died and rose again, what is stopping us from giving our full-hearted yes to him!
<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK: **
Jesus is the reason for the season, when He is in his right place we can enjoy Christmas for what it really is.
