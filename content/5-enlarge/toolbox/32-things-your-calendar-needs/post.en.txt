**KEY POINTS:**
Four things your calendar needs for you to live a big life this year:
1) Big picture 
2) Community
3) Your Areas of Responsibility
4) Your Personal Life
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**
**When we walk in faith and not in fear, then God can make the impossible possible.**
This year, we believe for the impossible to become possible. One of the ways we can do this is by starting with our calendars. Calendars are one of the great tools of progress. Calendars are not just a collection of dates, calendars communicate what you value, how you spend your time and what is important to you.
<br>
**Four things your calendar needs:**
1) The Big Picture.
The Big picture is everything that is bigger than ourselves. What we allocate time to and when shows the foundation of our values. For us as Church, Easter, Christmas and Heart for the House are important. We also value Hillsong Conference and Colour Conference gatherings where we see us as part of the bigger picture.

2) Community
To live big lives, we need each other! We are better in community. You can’t be a part of community and give nothing of yourself: community is two-sided. We value Dinner Parties during the week. We believe that it is important to come together as a small group to pray and share life together. 

3) Your area of responsibility
Everyone has areas of responsibility. May it be your job, your university or your responsibilities while serving on team. 

4) Put your personal life in
Your personal life is not the least important, but the most flexible part of your calendar. When you live a big life and put everything in, you’ll see all the gaps and spaces for opportunities. It will help you to make good decisions for the bigger picture of your life. Maybe you have several important projects, but by scheduling them first, there is more room for personal time and experiences.
<br>
**CONCLUSION: **
Allocate time in line with your values. To live a big life, put God first in everything! God gives us instructions that we need to pay attention to. This year there will be mountains and giants to be conquered but God has already gone before us. God’s not going to write your calendar, you are. Put God first in every week and see what happens.

**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK: **
What do you need to overcome this year?
Take time to think about what your values are and what your goals are for the year. Write these things into your calendar now and see your year take shape!
