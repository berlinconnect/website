**KEY POINTS:**
1. We **cannot offend Jesus** with our mistakes, we can only learn from them.
2. Our mistakes are not our identity. It's not about what we do, but **who we are becoming** in Jesus's name.
3. We are ordinary people with an **extraordinary God**.
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**
**Lessons learned from mistakes in 2015**
<br>
**Juls**
When we are in a place of failure, it’s about making sure we can **separate the failure** from our identity. We make mistakes but it doesn’t mean we **are** a mistake. 
It’s not about how much time and skill we have – it’s about our heart and the way we look at things. It’s about trusting that **God has our future**. He’ll never give us more than we can carry but he **enlarges** us and **challenges** us.
<br>
**David**
When we begin to work in an area we don’t feel is our natural strength, we have to trust God.
 <br>
**Susi**
Remember: **we cannot offend Jesus**. We cannot make any mistake that will take away this grace. Sometimes we do things well – and when we don’t, **we learn from them**! It’s about stepping out of our comfort zone and **not being afraid of mistakes**.
<br>
**Conny**
We have to remember that it’s not about what we **do**, but who we are **becoming**.
<br>
**Andres**
We **can’t do everything alone**. We have to work **with** people and **through** people, and we need people to come with us on the journey! When we work with others, we also need to **think things through** more carefully. So putting ourselves in this position means we can actually **do more**, because we have to plan our time! It makes **us work smarter** and use our time and resources better
<br>
**Why do we keep coming back to church?**
<br>
**Daniel**
I wouldn’t be happy without church! We’re here because we believe in Jesus and his Church, and we love to see people’s lives **move forward**. It's an** honour** to be here. And I’ve got better since I joined team, so it’s a win-win situation!
<br>
**David**
Being in Australia taught me the potential of the local church. I want to see the same **heartbeat** expressed here, and help to create a place where people can **grow and meet Jesus**.
<br>
**Conny**
When you know how much you’re **loved**, you can’t just hold it in. When you have a relationship with Jesus and know **what he’s done**, you can’t just walk away from that! We’re here to **love people and invest into people**. My goal is to see others meeting Jesus and discovering their purpose. It’s something that keeps you going! Of course, we could always **walk away** – but what would be a better option?
<br>
**Juls**
I made a decision to serve the Lord and build his house. It’s what I’ve decided to do in life, and there’s no option not to do that now. There are times when I get close to giving up – but every time I almost throw it away, something in me says “**no**.” There’s something special about seeing people **make their peace with God**. I want to be there when they do!
<br>
**Susi**
Growing up, church was like a **family** for me. I had this privilege and I want to make room for others to experience the same. I want to help others have a **family in faith**, who support you even when things are tough.
<br>
**Andres**
When we have busy lives, it’s about not **thinking in boxes**. We could box things up, for example life, church, family, etc. and feel bad when certain things take time from other boxes. But we’re the **same person** everywhere! I’m part of **something bigger**, and I want to keep growing.
<br>
**CONCLUSION: **
None of these people are scared to say yes! None of them have given an excuse; they’ve just learned to **trust God**. Excuses are easy, but having **no excuse** takes courage. This courage comes from our knowledge that we are a church of **ordinary people with an extraordinary God**.
<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK: **
What mistakes have we made in the past year, and what have we learned from them?  Also, why do we keep coming back to church, and making room for Jesus in our lives?
