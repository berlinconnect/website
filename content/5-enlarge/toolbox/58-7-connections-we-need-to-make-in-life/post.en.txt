**The Book of Ephesians**
<br>
**Key Points:**
1. The book of Ephesians teaches about connections that are vital for growing up spiritually.
2. We cannot go the distance by living in isolation, we need to make the right connections in life.
<br>
**Key Scriptures + Concepts:**
**1. The Christ connection**
**Ephesians 1:3-5 NLT**
All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms because we are united with Christ. Even before he made the world, God loved us and chose us in Christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes. God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ. This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure.
<br>
**2. The purpose connection**
**Ephesians 2:10 CEV**
God planned for us to do good things and to live as he has always wanted us to live. That's why he sent Christ to make us what we are.
<br>
**3. The power connection**
**Ephesians 3:20 NLT**
Now all glory to God, who is able, through his mighty power at work within us, to accomplish infinitely more than we might ask or think.
<br>
**4. The leadership connection**
**Ephesians 4:11-12 NLT**
Now these are the gifts Christ gave to the church: the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the pastors and teachers. Their responsibility is to PREPARE God’s people to do his work and build up the church, the body of Christ.
<br>
**5. The church connection**
**Ephesians 4:15-16 NLT**
Instead, we will speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ, who is the head of his body, the church. He makes the whole body fit together perfectly. As each part does its own special work, it helps the other parts grow, so that the whole body is healthy and growing and full of love.
<br>

**6. The relationship connection**
**Ephesians 5:1-2 NLT**
Follow God’s example in everything you do, because you are his dear children. Live a life filled with love for others following the example of Christ.
<br>
**7. The Holy Spirit connection**
**Ephesians 5:18 CEV**
Don't destroy yourself by getting drunk, but let the Spirit fill your life.
<br>
**Thoughts for your week:**
What are practical ways on how you can strenghten and invest into each of these connections?
