RELIEF, PARTNERSHIP, REFORM (REAL FAITH LEADS TO ACTION)

**Two kinds of poverty & the strategy:**
1. Physical poverty = relief, partnership & reform
2. Spiritual poverty = proclaim, preach & teach

**To help the poor we need to know:
What's the priority of the local church?** 
It means first that the Gospel must be proclaimed. 
1. WE TALK - We proclaim – preach & teach.
2. WE WALK - We do – love & serve.


**God's way is to be spiritually alive & physically involved.**

The Gospel is the reason behind all Christian practice individually, corporately.
The Gospel is not only proclaiming it to people so that they will embrace and believe it; it is also teaching and shepherding believers so they can ‘live it out’ in society.

The Gospel affects our relationship to the poor:
Because am loved – I can love others.
Because am accepted – I can accept others.
Because am forgiven – I can forgive others.
Because am approved by Christ – I don’t need to seek the approval of others.
Because am loved by Christ – I don’t need to seek love from others to make me complete.
Because am complete in Christ – I don’t need to seek it from others or in other things.


**To help the poor we need to know:
What's our true motivation for helping?** 
Why do you serve? Help the poor? Why do you live for Christ? Why do you do what you do?

The Gospel fuels our motivation for helping & serving others.
If you don’t live your life today from the Gospel, you will live your life today from your past.
It transforms me on a daily basis giving me the right motivation to live life helping others .

The difference between charity & justice?
The Good Samaritan: we see medical care, financial involvement, personal involvement. 
Show mercy - bring justice into the situation.
We see someone from a different background involved in the life of someone considered different (cultural/racial barriers removed).


**To help the poor we need to know:
What's our strategy?** 

1. RELIEF is direct help – it’s when we work together to help someone out. 

2. PARTNERSHIP –  a plan to lift people out of their current situation so they can help themselves and others (nurse, doctors, engineers).

3. REFORM – looking at social change, legal policy, social reform re-thinking systems & methods, lawyers, policy makers, film makers, story tellers, journalists and so on.

We are called out of darkness into his marvelous light. God sends us back into the darkness to shine brightly by being planted and connected to a healthy local church community.
