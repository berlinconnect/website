**Key Points: **
1. We are going nowhere, if we do not have a relationship with Jesus. Through this relationship, God takes us to places we can not even imagine.
2. There is no condemnation to those who live in Christ.
3. Let’s establish a healthy rhythm in our life, not a habit.
4. Let God be God in your life.

**Key Scriptures + Concepts: **

**Acts 4:32-35  (NLT)**
All the believers were united in heart and mind. And they felt that what they owned was not their own, so they shared everything they had. The apostles testified powerfully to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and God’s great blessing was upon them all. There were no needy people among them, because those who owned land or houses would sell them and bring the money to the apostles to give to those in need.

**Identity**
It doesn’t matter what our personal story is, we all have to navigate identity, but the Gospel tells us that he made us in His image - you don’t know who you are until you know who God is. If you don’t build your identity on God, you will dangerously build your identity on what you do - successes and failures.
Let’ Him be at the center of your life, and you will find that everything will start to change.
The Gospel is the only thing that can keep us in the relationship with him everyday as it gets us started but it keeps us in all the way.

**No Condemnation **
There is no condemnation to those who are in Christ (Romans 8:1).
No condemnation means  that we can enjoy the relationship with Christ, not because we are perfect, but because He is perfect. He removed all the obstacles we had, so stop bring them up.
He died so that you and I will never have another obstacle to enjoy our relationship with God.

**Habit vs Rhythm **
We do a lot of things out of habit, but rhythm includes a vision why we do it.
Habit - you don’t know why you do it, but you just do it because we think it’s the only way.
Rhythm strengthens a relationship (marriage, friendship, raising children) because there is more than on way to achieve the objective, which only enlarges you.

**Conclusion:**
Let’s focus on building a relationship with Christ. Jesus is the narrow way, but it leads to a broad life. If you want to live a broad life - you need to narrow yourself and focus on Him.

**Thoughts for your week: **
Let’s focus on getting to know Jesus and establish a relationship with him. As a church we need to really understand that we need to start, continue and finish with Jesus - we need the Gospel all the way.
