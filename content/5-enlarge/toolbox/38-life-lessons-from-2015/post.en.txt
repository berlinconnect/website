**KEY POINTS:**
1. We don’t have to remain **prisoners of our past**, because Jesus has taken care of everything.
2. God is more interested in **who we are becoming** than what we are doing – and He is always there behind the scenes, working on the **bigger picture** that we can’t always see.
3. When we say “**yes**” to God, He can work with that – and He can help us to **grow**.
 <br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**
 <br>
**Franzi**
I’ve learned to say yes!
We have lots of gaps - but with Jesus, we can move forwards even when we think our life is a mess. When we have moments that make us think: “**how I do get out of this?!**” we can trust God to get us out of it and help us grow.
 <br> 
James 4:7-10 (MSG) “So let God work his will in you. Yell a loud no to the Devil and watch him scamper. Say a quiet yes to God and he’ll be there in no time. […] Get down on your knees before the Master; it’s the only way you’ll get on your feet.”
 
We have to say “yes” despite the challenges: we can give **all the mountains** in our life to God! He can do something with our “yes,” but He can’t do anything with our “no.”
  <br>
**Victor**
Sometimes we don’t realise that our inner struggles show outwardly – but when people see that we are struggling, they can help us.
It’s helpful to speak about the things we’re dealing with, and church is a place where people can help each other. People can see **where we are** and help each other to **grow**.
We don’t have to remain **prisoners of our past**! Jesus took care of all of that for us. He is our saviour.
  <br>
**Marylin**
Sometimes we ask ourselves: “**Why are there no opportunities? Why has God put me here?**” – but God is already at work in our lives, even when we think all the doors are closed.
 
God is always working behind the scenes. We don’t always see the **big picture**, but He does – and when we can **trust God with the details**, we know we have a good relationship with Him.
It’s all about knowing that God’s with us, He’s for us, and we can trust Him every step of the way.
  <br>
**Phil**
My biggest lesson was that I’m not as good as I think I am!
We can try to do all sorts of things in our own strength, achieving and striving for success - but sometimes we’ll find that as much as we push, doors still seem to close.
This is because God is much more interested in who we are becoming than what we are doing. If we focus too much on what we are doing, he’ll shut the doors, prompting us to stop and take notice. He can do that: He’s God!
God can point out blind spots in our lives. When this happens, we have a choice of how to respond. We can be proud or humble – and when we are humble, we receive His grace.
  <br>
**CONCLUSION:**
We are all **unfinished stories**. It doesn’t matter where we started. Everyone has a past – but our message is not about being perfect, but about letting** God’s goodness** surround us.
It can be a challenge for us to surrender, because we want to be in control. But if we live **surrendered** to God, we live **surrounded** by His grace and goodness!
We don’t need to ask: “**am I good enough for God?**” but rather: “**is Jesus good enough?**”
Jesus sets the tone. He is our standard in everything – and if we let Jesus be where he needs to be in our lives, he’ll take us where **only he** can take us.
 <br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK:**
When it seems like somebody might be struggling, let’s be the kind of church who asks “**how are you?**” and helps each other to grow.
We can also help ourselves to grow, by saying “**yes**” to God and trusting him with the details.
God can see things in our lives that we cannot even imagine yet – it’s exciting what He has in store for us, and all we have to do is **surrender** to Him, say “**yes**” to Him and **trust** Him every step of the way.
