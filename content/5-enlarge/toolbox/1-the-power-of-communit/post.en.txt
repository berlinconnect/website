**Mo – “We gather around His name”**
God loves us, and He is for us. He chose us a long time ago: all we have to do is choose him back!
Being part of a healthy community and Dinner Party with purpose has impacted and changed my life forever and equipped me with tools for life. Dinner Parties aren’t about becoming like everyone else – they are about discovering your uniqueness, building healthy, authentic relationships with people and helping others to build a relationship with God. We might not have all the answers, but Jesus does, and we gather around His name.
There is nothing that can stop us building a good, healthy church in Berlin. Joining a Dinner Party has turned my life around in ways I never thought it could.  
<br>
**Johannes – “We’re walking in the footsteps of Jesus!”**
Never underestimate what can happen around a table of friendship and food. Jesus invites himself to Zacchaeus’s home because he wants to sit around a table with him. One meal with Jesus and everything has changed for Zacchaeus. With our Dinner Parties we are walking in the footsteps of Jesus! There’s no magic behind it: it’s just hospitality, generosity, opening up our homes and sharing our lives with each other.
<br>
**Maria – “God uses other people to speak to us”**
God has given us all the things we need to bless someone else. What has God given me that I can multiply and increase, like these two servants?
God sometimes uses other people to speak to us, bless us, encourage us and challenge us to be the person He’s called us to be. What might someone see in me that I cannot see in myself? Likewise, what might we see in other people, that God has blessed them with, and wants to bring out?
The man who buried his talent had the wrong perception of his master: he was afraid. But the servants who multiplied their talents had the right perception of their master. They trusted him and were not afraid. God has given us so much: do we know Him and trust Him well enough to multiply and increase what he has given us?
<br>
**Conclusion:**
God has given us what we need to help each other become who He has called us to be. Our Dinner Parties with purpose are a space for us to encourage each other, share our lives with each other and discover new things about ourselves and each other.
<br>
**Thoughts for the week:**
What tools has God given me that I could multiply and increase to help other people? And do I trust God to help me with this? He has given us everything we need – including each other. When we share our lives and help each other grow closer to God, we keep His light going.
Our Dinner Parties are about community – and community means opening up to people and saying: “This is my weakness, I believe that you’ll still love me, take care of me, and go on this journey together with me.” It is also about realizing that in the same way, I can help and be there for those around me.
