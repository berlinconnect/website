**KEY POINTS:**
1. Walk in faith, not fear. When you see His grace, He will see your faith.
2. When we are weak, he is strong. Your weaknesses give His strength purpose.
3. Live under grace, not under the law. Grace fuels your faith, not your fears.
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**

**2 Corinthians 12:9 NIV**
But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me.

**John 1:17 NLT**
For the law was given through Moses, but God’s unfailing love and faithfulness came through Jesus Christ.

**Your identity is not in what you do, but who you are**
In the story of the rich young ruler (**Luke 18:18-30**), he asked Jesus what he can do to get eternal life but when Jesus told him he had to give everything to the poor he couldn’t do it. The next story in the Bible (**Luke 19:1-10**)  is about Zaccheus the tax collector, who after having dinner with Jesus announces he wants to give away his wealth. Here is a guy with no name who can’t let go, and a guy with an ordinary name who gives all he has. God gives more attention to **who you are** than what you do. It’s about identity.

The lady who was bleeding for 12 years (**Luke 8:43-48**) reaches out and touches Jesus in a crowd of people, believing she will be healed and she was. At that time a woman like her could have been punished for being in public, and especially to dare touch someone like Jesus. But instead of condemning her, Jesus calls her ‘**daughter**’ and tells her ‘**your faith has healed you**’. Calling her ‘daughter’ speaks to her identity, it tells her where she belongs. She had faith in an impossible situation.
<br>
**Walk in faith, not in fear**

In our culture we think weakness is a problem, but in **2 Corinthians 12:9** it says **His strength is made perfect in weakness**. His grace is all we need. When we see his grace, he will see our faith. When we arrive at the table, we are weak, but then we eat and you **leave strong**. Likewise, we come to church feeling weak, but leave strong. So let’s not hide our weaknesses - they give His strength purpose.
<br>
**Grace makes us, but law breaks us**

Grace feeds our **faith**, but law feeds our **fear**.
Grace is **fruitfulness**, and law is **barrenness**.
In grace we will **flourish**, but we’ll **die** under law. 
Grace is **His way**, and law is **our way**. 

Law means trying to do everything right, trying to do things our own way, but grace is His way. 

To walk in faith, we have to feed on His grace. When we see His grace, He sees our faith - where there’s grace, there is faith. 

If we have an impossible situation in our life, let’s **lift our faith up** and look at His grace. How do we know we’re under grace? We will be **more committed, not less**; our lives will be **bigger, not smaller;** and it will **fuel our faith, not our fear**. 
<br>
**CONCLUSION: **
If we walk in faith, not fear, God can turn our impossibles into possibles.
<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK:**
What are the things in our lives that seem impossible? Let’s hand them to God, and walk in faith, not in fear.
