**KEY POINTS:**
- Live a life full of vision, surrendered to God. 
- Make Jesus bigger than the mess and the mistakes. 
- God is taking care of the giants we face. 
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS:**
**We need Jesus all the way.**
Religion puts us under pressure to get things right: it is always about what we have to do, but the essence of the gospel is that everything is supplied by Jesus. We can take the pressure off of ourselves and put it on Him, because He lived the life that we could never live.
Jesus will keep us and take us all the way. He is better than religion. He gives us the space we need to breathe, something religion will never do.
Let’s make Jesus bigger than the mess and the mistakes, and let’s never get tired of the grace of God!
<br>
**Surrender**
It’s amazing how what we see and hear is different when we surrender to God and make Him Lord of our life. When we surrender to God, we see things that no-one else sees.
Submitted and surrendered people will always be used by God in the crazy areas of life - but we can’t get eyes to see and ears to hear without first surrendering to Him.
<br>
**A generation with vision **
Let’s not be a suspicious generation – let’s be a generation with a vision, and one that’s worth following. If we have vision, we will go somewhere in life – but if we don’t do something with life, life will do something with us. If we don’t put God at the centre of our lives, something will take His place.
<br>
**Facing giants**
When God’s people went into the Promised Land, they found giants and things that scared them. Why didn’t God tell them about the giants? Perhaps because he was letting them know that the giants were His problem, not theirs.
<br>
**CONCLUSION:**
God has us first, before any of the giants we might face. He has done everything already, He is ahead of the game, and is just waiting for us to catch up. So we can trust God in everything, from start to finish. 
<br>
**THOUGHTS FOR YOUR WEEK:**
Think about the giants you might face in the coming months. These are opportunities to make Jesus bigger than the mess, to put God at the centre of your life and to trust Him completely to take care of the giants. It’s amazing how things change when we surrender completely to Him!
