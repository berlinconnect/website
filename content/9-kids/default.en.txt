Our desire at Berlin Connect is to create a safe, fun-filled environment that children love coming to. The Next Generation Team are passionate about expressing the message of Jesus in a creative, relevant way. We pray that your children will encounter Jesus as their Lord and Saviour and grow up knowing who they are in Christ.

We truly believe that children are a gift from the Lord (Psalm 127:3) and count it an honour to play our part in raising champions.

We're providing a fun kids program in the morning during the 11 am and 1 pm service.
Doors open at 10:30 and 12:30. You are more than welcome to come earlier for a coffee or a hot chocolate!

**BABY DEDICATIONS**
Children are precious gifts from God and we take time in our Sunday services to dedicate babies. As a church, we believe baptism is an individual choice that children need to make for themselves when they are older and able to understand the implications of their decision. However, we also want to give new parents the opportunity to receive prayer for their families as they commit to raising their children in Godâ€™s house.
