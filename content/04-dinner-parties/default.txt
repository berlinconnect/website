Text: Dinner Parties with purpose are not merely about 'what is on' the table but more about 'who is around' the table.  Eating together in a relational way has great benefits for our lives as it creates a sense of belonging, caring, sharing and family. Itâ€™s a place where authentic friendships flourish and where we collectively express kindness locally and globally.

We get together fortnightly on Wednesdays in homes, cafes and bars across the city and would love to invite you to 'take your place' at the table and get connected into a Dinner Party.
