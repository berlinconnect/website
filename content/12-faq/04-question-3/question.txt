Title: Are you a cult or sect?
----
Text: No: We are a new local Protestant church that started 6 years ago. The Pastors studied for 6 years at Hillsong International Leadership College in Australia and received training in Church leadership and biblical theology. Berlin Connect was birthed out of Hillsong London as a connect group and has progressed into a vibrant, dynamic local church. Berlin Connect is a legal non-profit charitable organisation with church purposes, accountable to the German law and Finanzamt and is independent from the state church. We are a part of the Hillsong family and network.
