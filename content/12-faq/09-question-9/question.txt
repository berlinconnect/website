Title: How is Berlin Connect supported finaically?
----
Text: Berlin Connect is independent of the state church and government system and does not receive any church tax or funding from the government. We operate within the legal requirements of the Finanzamt as a charity with church purposes. All our finances come from the freewill giving of tithes and offerings from the people who call Berlin Connect their home. Our accounts are managed in a professional manner with an independent accounts company.
