Title: Do I have to believe in the bible?
----
Text: Anyone is welcome, people with doubts, sceptics and believers - hurt, broken, healthy and well. We are all learning that the Bible is not a book of religious quotes. It's "A WHOLE PERSON CALLED JESUS”. When you read the Bible with a mindset of "What do I have to do to please God?", you can always feel like you don’t measure up. But if you have a different mindset about the Bible and begin to realise that the Bible is about Christ and what He has done to please God on our behalf, it brings a deep joy that frees you to enjoy your relationship with God.
