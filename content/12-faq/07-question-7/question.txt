Title: Why gather?
----
Text: There is strength in unity that builds community. We gather to learn about hope, love and faith that come from trusting in Jesus and His kindness towards us. We gather to give thanks to the faithfulness of God in our lives. We come as we are and discover transformation by receiving God's love and choosing to trust in the finished work of Christ on the cross.
