Title: Will I have to give money in offering?
----
Text: Every offering taken at church is a FREEWILL offering. Tithing is a biblical principle of putting God first and honoring Him. People who come to Berlin Connect have the opportunity to contribute to building Godâ€™s house as a response to receiving Jesus and His grace for their life. Giving is choosing to live God's way.
