CommunityCopy: As a church we place great value on developing meaningful and personal connections midweek through our Dinner Parties and Sisterhood gatherings.
Dinner Parties are informal get-togethers that take place every fortnight on Wednesday nights in homes all across Berlin.

Sisterhood is all about placing value on women and gets together for morning tea every Thursday from 10:30 to 12:30 at the Hub.

SocietyQuote: Shining brightly in society

SocietyCopy: Our desire is to contribute to the well-being of society as a whole through social enterprise. Out of the overflow of our lives we can serve our city by getting involved, finding and supporting positive solutions that place value, speak to people's potential and point to vision that shapes a better society. Would be cool to have one more sentence about why we have partnerships, what we do locally and what Futureminded is. <!-- TO BE CHANGED-->
