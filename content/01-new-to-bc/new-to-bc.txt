CommunityQuote: Connecting our Sundays to our Midweek.

CommunityCopy: Sitting together around a table of friendship and family is important for all of us. As a church we place great value on developing meaningful and personal connections midweek through our Dinner Parties. These are hosted throughout the city and enable us to put into practice midweek what we are learning on Sundays.

Dinner Parties with purpose are not merely about 'what is on' the table but more about 'who is around' the table.
