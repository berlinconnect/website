Title: Do I have to believe in the Bible?

----

Text: Anyone is welcome, people with doubts, sceptics and believers - hurt, broken, healthy and well. We are all learning that the Bible is not a book of religious quotes. It's "A WHOLE PERSON CALLED JESUS”. When you read the Bible with a "What do I have to do to please God?” mindset, you can feel like you don’t measure up. But, if you read the Bible with an “it’s all about Christ and what He has done to please God on my behalf" mindset, it changes everything enabling you to enjoy and grow in your relationship with your heavenly Father.
