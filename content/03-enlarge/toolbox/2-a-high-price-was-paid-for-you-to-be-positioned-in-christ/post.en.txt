**Week 2**
<br>

**Romans 6:23 NLT **
For the payment of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord.

The payment of your sin and my sin is death (separation from God) but the good news is Jesus paid that price for you and me. God's Word tells us that the precious Blood of Jesus purchased us for God and that the Holy Spirit now lives in us.

**Revelation 5:9 NLV **
They sang a new song, saying, it is right for Jesus to take the book and break its locks. It is because Jesus was killed. Jesusâ€™ blood has bought men for God from every family and from every language and from every kind of people and from every nation on earth.

Why did Jesus purchase us with His own blood? Because of His deep love for us. He deeply desires to have a loving relationship with you and I.
