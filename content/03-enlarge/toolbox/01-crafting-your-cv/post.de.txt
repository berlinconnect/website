Text:

In John 8:32 Jesus says ‘You will know the truth and the truth will set you free.’ (NLT)
The word know means to be intimate with. When you are in a close relationship with Christ Jesus, you learn so much about His love for you and His faithful character towards you. This intimacy leads to knowing the truth in a way that you experience freedom and joy in your everyday life as a believer. Knowing God’s truth is the key to live in freedom.
