What does it mean to be positioned with authority? 

Jesus has a position of authority over sickness, disease, death and anything that would 
seek to hinder God’s promise and God’s blessing in our lives. 

Imagine a Berlin policeman standing in the road of a busy intersection and the traffic 
lights are broken. You could image the chaos that would happen. The policeman is not 
physically able to stop the traffic and give direction and instructions to the oncoming 
vehicles, but something happens when the drivers of those vehicles see the uniform and the authority that the uniform represents. The ability of the policeman is not found in 
the police itself but in whom the policeman represents. 

This is a similar picture to the authority you have because of Christ in your life. Because 
Christ has defeated death, hell and all sickness & disease, you are able to use your God-given authority to speak to any situation that tries to steal from you or rob you of all 
that God has made available to you… 

If sickness tries to steal your health, take authority in Jesus name and speak to your 
body and mind the word of God and declare God’s promises over your life. 

Be encouraged today and remind yourself of your true place in life. You are seated 
with Christ which positions you with God-given authority to speak life over your life and 
over any situation you face. Christ gave everything to position you and me in a place of Godly authority so the enemy cannot steal from us anymore.
