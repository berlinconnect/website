**Key Points:**
1. Enlarge your tent/house.
2. You cannot be who you’re called to be without knowing Jesus Christ. 
3. God sends a person – Jesus Christ, to bring back humanity into a relationship with the father. 
4. You cannot enlarge without a sense of Godly purpose. 
<br>

**Key Scriptures + Concepts:
Isaiah 54:1-2 NCV**
...Make your tent bigger; stretch it out and make it wider.
Do not hold back. Make the ropes longer and its stakes stronger.
<br>
**Ecclesiastes 3:11 NLT**
Yet God has made everything beautiful for its own time. He has planted eternity in the human heart, a divinely implanted sense of a purpose working through the ages which nothing under the sun but God alone can satisfy, but even so, people cannot see the whole scope of God’s work from beginning to end.
<br>
**We were made for BIGGER things.**
We were not made to live for ourselves but for God - and for people. We were wired for greatness and should not shrink our lives down to what we see or our past. Live your life according to the promises of God.

When the Israelites were suppressed, God told them to enlarge their lives regardless of their circumstances.

**Mark 16:19-20 J.B. Phillips Translation (see also: Message Translation)**
After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was taken up into Heaven and was enthroned at the right hand of God. They went out and preached everywhere. **The Lord worked with them, confirming their message by the signs that followed.**

The “signs” that follow us are in context of our culture and time. Our church message should not be disconnected from real life. Sundays are about preparing us for Monday. 
<br>
**Conclusion:**
**5 signs that will follow those who believe:**
Servanthood = whoever, whenever. Serving others, meeting needs with no strings attached.  We are here to encourage, uplift and edify. Servanthood leads to influence.
Excellence = Not how you do it, but who you are doing it for. Go the extra mile. Like Daniel (scripture??), plans can be made for you, when people see excellence in your life.
The Cause of Christ = It’s the true motivation. 
Submission = Flowing and aligning yourself with the purposes of Jesus.
Generosity = Adding value in the way you think, see, speak and act. Generosity is a lifestyle.

**Thoughts for your week:**
What will cause you to stand out this year? What are the signs that will follow you?
