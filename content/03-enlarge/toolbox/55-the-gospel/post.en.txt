**Key Points: **
1. The Gospel is the power of God for our salvation. 
2. The Gospel is Jesus. It is not about what you have to do, it is about what Jesus has already done.
3. Our committment as a church is to lift up Jesus, in whom all salvation lies. 
<br>
**Key Scriptures + Concepts: **
**Romans 1:16+17 NLT**
For I am not ashamed of this Good News about Christ. It is the power of God at work, saving everyone who believes—the Jew first and also the Gentile. This Good News tells us how God makes us right in his sight. This is accomplished from start to finish by faith. As the Scriptures say, “It is through faith that a righteous person has life.”

**What is the Gospel? How can it enlarge you daily? **
The Gospel is God’s power for you and me to walk in freedom. 
The Gospel is not just the entry point to christianity, it is also the continuation. 
The Gospel is the power of God for our salvation. 
<br>
- Salvation means “nothing broken, nothing missing, all things restored". It is the power of God to restore all that humanity needs. 
- Salvation doesn’t just cover the past. Salvation includes the removal of all our sins. Past, present, and future. 
- Salvation lies in Jesus. Salvation means that God put everything we have ever done wrong on Jesus. 
- Salvation meant that we are sanctified. The blood of Christ is still working today on our behalf. We can therefore enter into a relationship with Christ Jesus. God looks at us through His sacrificed Son, not through our sins anymore. 
- Salvation says you’re worthy. 
<br>
**Conclusion:
Our job is to point people to Jesus. The Gospel is Jesus. **
You will never let go of something, unless there is something better to take hold of.
The Gospel is about lifting up something better - something worth to take hold of. 
The Gospel is not about what you have to do, it’s about what Jesus has already done.

**Thoughts for your week: **
Dive into the Gospel anew. Get “back to the basics” and discover the power that lies in the Gospel. Remember, you need the Gospel daily.
