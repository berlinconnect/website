**Key Points: **
1. The gospel is about a relationship, not legalim or liberalism.
2. Legalism and liberalism are two rivers that come from the same source.
3. The good news makes God’s grace bigger, not our sin.

**Key Scriptures + Concepts:**

**Colossians 2:13-23 NLT**
You were dead because of your sins and because your sinful nature was not yet cut away. Then God made you alive with Christ, **for he forgave all our sins. 14 He canceled the record of the charges against us and took it away by nailing it to the cross. 15 In this way, he disarmed[a] the spiritual rulers and authorities. He shamed them publicly by his victory over them on the cross.** 16 So don’t let anyone condemn you for what you eat or drink, or for not celebrating certain holy days or new moon ceremonies or Sabbaths. 17 For these rules are only shadows of the reality yet to come. And Christ himself is that reality. 18 Don’t let anyone condemn you by insisting on pious self-denial or the worship of angels,[b] saying they have had visions about these things. **Their sinful minds have made them proud, 19 and they are not connected to Christ, the head of the body.** For he holds the whole body together with its joints and ligaments, and it grows as God nourishes it.
20 You have died with Christ, and he has set you free from the spiritual powers of this world. So why do you keep on following the rules of the world, such as, 21 “Don’t handle! Don’t taste! Don’t touch!”? 22 Such rules are mere human teachings about things that deteriorate as we use them. 23 These rules may seem wise because they require strong devotion, pious self-denial, and severe bodily discipline. But they provide no help in conquering a person’s evil desires.

1 John 2:15-17 NLT
Do not love this world nor the things it offers you, for when you love the world, you do not have the love of the Father in you. 16 For the world offers only a craving for physical pleasure, a craving for everything we see, **and pride in our achievements and possessions**. These are not from the Father, but are from this world. 17 And this world is fading away, along with everything that people crave. But anyone who does what pleases God will live forever.

**Losing your religion **
The key to losing your religion is humility. Humility is right identity. 
Humility flourishes around grace. - Pride flourishes around religion. 

**Legalism and liberalism **
Legalism and liberalism are two rivers that come from the same source. 
Religion exists because sin exists. - You get one, you get the other. 

**Change the mindset  **
Religion is the fruit of a belief system.
Religion is a behavior built from a set of values that come from a belief system.
Change the belief, change the values.
Change the values, change the behavior.
Change the behavior, change the religion.
 
 
**Thoughts for your week: **
Legalism and liberalism both narrow broadness. Let’s live according to the gospel which truly leads to a broad life.
