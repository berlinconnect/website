<br>
**Key Scriptures + Concepts:**
**Matthew 9:35-38 (MSG) **
35-38 Then Jesus made a circuit of all the towns and villages. He taught in their meeting places, reported kingdom news, and healed their diseased bodies, healed their bruised and hurt lives. When he looked out over the crowds, his heart broke. So confused and aimless they were, like sheep with no shepherd. “What a huge harvest!” he said to his disciples. “How few workers! On your knees and pray for harvest hands!”
<br>
Matthew 10:5-8 (MSG) 
5-8 Jesus sent his twelve harvest hands out with this charge:
“Don’t begin by traveling to some far-off place to convert unbelievers. And don’t try to be dramatic by tackling some public enemy. Go to the lost, confused people right here in the neighborhood. Tell them that the kingdom is here. Bring health to the sick. Raise the dead. Touch the untouchables. Kick out the demons. **You have been treated generously, so live generously.**”
<br>
**Jesus saw there was a need and immediately went to a solution. He did so by**
- getting involved in people’s lives, 
- coming close, 
- and not staying distant. 
In doing so, he made the invisible God visible. 
<br>
**Generosity works through relationships and operates from grace**
We are called to do the same because the God we serve is about bringing positive solutions to humanity. However, if we don’t put God in the picture, we can get overwhelmed with the need in our world and then we pull back. By putting God in the centre, we can get involved in people’s lives.
Generosity works through relationships (the way we treat people who know and those we don’t know personally) and operates from what we have received: Grace from our Saviour, Jesus. Generosity is always personal!
<br>
**Generosity...**
- Has nothing to do with how much or how little you have.
- Has everything to do with the bigness of your heart.
- Operates from what we have received - Grace.
- Is always personal.
- Is big hearted, big spirited.
- Believes the best.
- Gets involved.
- Can work with little and much.
- Is who you are so it affects everything that you do.
<br>
**Generosity is an answer to the world we live in**
Maybe you don’t know how to answer the questions from the people around you. When your friends have questions from family and friends who struggle to believe what we do, don’t put yourself under pressure to know everything. Generosity is your answer! But remember to allow God to reveal His generosity to you first.
<br>
**Conclusion: **
You have been treated generously, now treat others generously. What is attractive is that people can see relationships in ways they haven’t seen before. Generosity is an answer to the questions of the people around you that you can not answer. Generosity is an answer to what is happening in the world we live in. Do not forget that generosity is an answer to broken hearts and can bring lost sons and daughters home.

**Thoughts for your week: **
How many people are watching you in the distance - the way you carry yourself, how you treat others, how you speak about others, and how you act when you think nobody's watching? How do you treat people in your different environments - those you know and those you don’t?
