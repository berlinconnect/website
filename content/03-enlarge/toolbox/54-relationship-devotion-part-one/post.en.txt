**Key Points:** 
1. The good news points to Jesus, Jesus points you to His Church, the Church prepares you for a life of meaning and purpose.
2. When Jesus is at the center, others are the focus.
3. Legalism and liberalism both lead to a narrow life - the Gospel leads to a broad life.

**Key Scriptures + Concepts: **

**Luke 14:16-24 J.B. Phillips **
“Once upon a time, a man planned a big dinner party and invited a great many people. At
dinner-time, he sent his servant out to tell those who were invited, ‘Please come, everything is
ready now.’ But they all, as one man, began to make their excuses: 

1. The first one said to him, ‘I have bought some land. I must go and look at it. Please excuse me.’ 
He was preoccupied with **possessions**.
2. Another one said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen and am on my way to try them out. Please convey my apologies.’  
He was preoccupied with **career and work**. 
3. Another one said, ‘I have just got married and I am sure you will understand I cannot come.’  
He was preoccupied with **relationships**. 

… So the servant returned and reported all this to his master. The master of the house was extremely annoyed and said to his servant, ‘Hurry out now into the streets and alleys of the town, and bring here the poor and crippled and blind and lame.’ Then the servant said, ‘I have done what you told me, sir, and there are still empty places.’ Then the master replied, ‘Now go out to the roads and hedgerows and make them come inside, so that my house may be full. For I tell you that not one of the men I invited shall have a taste of my dinner party. 

**Matthew 19:16-26 MSG**
Another day, a man stopped Jesus and asked, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?” Jesus said, “Why do you question me about what’s good? God is the One who is good. If you want to enter the life of God, just do what he tells you.”
The man asked, “What in particular?” Jesus said, “Don’t murder, don’t commit adultery, don’t steal, don’t lie, honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as you do yourself.” The young man said, “I’ve done all that. What’s left?” “If you want to give it all you’ve got,” Jesus replied, “go sell your possessions; give everything to the poor. All your wealth will then be in heaven. Then come follow me.” That was the last thing the young man expected to hear. And so, **devastated**, he walked away. He was holding on tight to a lot of things, and he couldn’t bear to let go.

**The rich young ruler**
Jesus welcomes and invites the rich young ruler, but he declines. His identity is in what he has not who he is.

**Conclusion: **
The story about the rich young ruler challenges us: Don’t hide behind your relationships, work or possessions.

**Thoughts for your week: **
Let’s remind ourselves daily of the Gospel, of who we are in Jesus instead of building our identity on our relationships, our work or our possessions.
