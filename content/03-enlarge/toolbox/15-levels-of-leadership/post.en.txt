**1. Introduction **
“Leadership is a process not a position“ John C. Maxwell shows in his “5 Levels of Leadership“ that influential leadership is a lot more than being given a position! To get to a point where people actually want to follow, catch the heart & vision of what we are about, make it their own and take responsibility for taking it forward, conscious effort and investment into people and their lives is required.

**2. For whom is the book?**
This book really is for everyone. You might think you are not a leader, but we all have (good or bad) influence in some sphere of our lives, whether we know and use it or not. We could be a parent, teacher, au pair, big brother or sister influencing the next generation, a student leading a project group or tutoring others, a musician or singer leading a band, an employee advising & helping customers, a coach in sports or business helping others to reach their potential, a manager in a company with lots of employees, a pastor or leader of a team in church caring for people and helping them move forward…  – no matter who we are, this book can help each one of us to make good use of the influence we have been given and to have a positive impact on the people in our world! 
  <br>
**3. Key thoughts of the book**
The idea is to help us reach our full potential, through understanding the process of gaining respect, trust, loyalty and committment from the people we lead, realizing where we are at on this journey and learning what the next steps are to move forward. 
Maxwell describes 5 different levels on the journey of leadership:
**1) Position** – A role you’ve been given. People only follow because they have to, but they won’t go any further than the rules and regulations allow them.
**2) Permission** – A place where people start to follow because they know you and want to. It is based on relationship.
3) Production – People follow because you get things done and tangible results are achieved.
**4) People Development **– People follow because you have invested into their personal lives and are empowering them to reach their full potential.
**5) Pinnacle **– The top end! People follow because of your reputation and legacy – because of who you are and what you represent.
 
In each one of these levels we can decide whether we camp there or move on to get to a place of actually making a difference in our world. Maxwell makes it very clear that standing still will limit us and the people we lead whereas moving forward will require conscious steps and constant personal growth. But the further we get the greater the return and the easier it gets to lead.

**4. Personal Experience**
The book was an amazing personal check-up for me. Realising what level I’m on  in different areas of my life was very interesting. Whether it’s in my work as a dance teacher or in church leading a group of dancers and a Dinner party and being part of the team leading Youth – it was very helpful for me to step into the shoes of an objective outside observer and see the levels of leadership I am or have been on with people. I was encouraged to learn to become more effective in everything I do and really see peoples hearts, their dreams and passions, and help them reach their full potential in life. It also made me realise that we don’t just move on to the next levels naturally, but instead have to put in some work to grow as a person. If working on myself and my committment towards the people that I have been entrusted with is what it takes to be a worldchanger, I see it as a challenge I want to rise to. Thankfully, I have a lot of role models who live out what this book talks about in theory. This book will continue to help understand the process of getting to the levels they are at.

“Leaders become great, not because of their power but because of their ability to empower others.“ (p.9)
Who can you empower in your circle of influence?
