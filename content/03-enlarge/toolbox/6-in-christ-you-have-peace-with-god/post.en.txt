**Week 6**
<br>

We have been justified and made right with God; therefore we have peace with God. This means that your relationship with God has been restored legally and with justice done on your behalf. You can boldly enter God’s presence with a clean conscience because of your faith (TRUST) in Christ Jesus and the work that He's done for us on the cross. 

**Romans 5:1-2 J.B. Phillips **
Since then it is by faith that we are justified, let us grasp the fact that we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we have confidently entered into this new relationship of grace, and here we take our stand, in happy certainty of the glorious things he has for us in the future. 
 
God’s kindness and grace does not mean we have a license to keep sinning, no way, God’s kindness and grace makes it possible for us to sin less – we get better with kindness and grace, not worse. 
 
Live as a son/daughter of Grace not as a slave to sin. Live from peace not for peace.
