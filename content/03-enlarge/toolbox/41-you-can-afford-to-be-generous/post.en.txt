**Key Points: **
1. You can afford to be generous because our generous God supplies.
2. Generousity makes room for other people and is the key to unlocking a great harvest.
<br>
**Key Scriptures + Concepts:**
**Philippians 4:10-18**
10 I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it. 11 I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. 12 I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. 13 I can do all this through him who gives me strength. 14 Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles. 15 Moreover, as you Philippians know, in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel, when I set out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only; 16 for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid more than once when I was in need. 17 Not that I desire your gifts; what I desire is that more be credited to your account. 18 I have received full payment and have more than enough. I am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God. 19 And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.

**Happiness based on money**
Don’t let your happiness be based on what you have or don’t have. We can fall in the trap of basing our identity on our possessions, but they don’t give us the peace we need.
<br>
**Generosity**
One of the greatest things that releases others in their faith is generosity. You can afford to be generous because our God generously supplies. It is not about how much money you have but about the generous attitude of your heart. Generousity makes room not just for you, but for other people. Generousity has been one of the greatest keys for releasing the church into the biggest harvest. God owns everything, all that you have belongs to him. The good news is all that he has belongs to you, too.
<br>

**Conclusion:**
The little you have
Look at what you have in your life. Thank God for it, pray His blessing over it and then release it.
<br>

**Thoughts for your week: **
Say it over your life: I am a generous person because God, my father, generously supplies.
