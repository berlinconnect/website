**Key Points:**
What strengthens any relationship is not the absence of problems but the presence of problems.
Relationships are made stronger when they are tested and proven.
How you work through disagreements, disappointments and discouragement is what will determine if you’ll go the distance. 
<br>
**Key Scriptures + Concepts:**
**Romans 5:1-5 NLT**
Therefore, since we have been made right in God’s sight by faith, we have peace with God because of what Jesus Christ our Lord has done for us. 2 Because of our faith, Christ has brought us into this place of undeserved privilege. A new relationship where we now stand, and we confidently and joyfully look forward to sharing God’s glory.
3 We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they help us develop endurance. 4 And endurance develops strength of character, and character strengthens our confident hope of salvation. 5 And this hope will not lead to disappointment. For we know how dearly God loves us, because he has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love.

**We all need to navigate disappointment, disagreement, disctraction.**
Disappointment - Who/what has disappointed you? Why are you disappointed?
Don’t allow disappointment to take you away from your God-given appointment for your life.
Disagreement - It’s unlikely there will never be any disagreements in relationships, one of the ways to navigate this is to unite around a common purpose/the big picture.
Distraction - Refocus on what got you attracted to Jesus in the first place.
