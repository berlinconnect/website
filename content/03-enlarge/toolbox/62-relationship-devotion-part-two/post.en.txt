####Key Points:
1. The gospel is about a relationship, not legalim or liberalism.
2. Legalism and liberalism are two rivers that come from the same source.
3. The good news makes God’s grace bigger, not our sin.

####Losing your religion
The key to losing your religion is humility. Humility is right identity.
Humility flourishes around grace. - Pride flourishes around religion.

####Legalism and liberalism
Legalism and liberalism are two rivers that come from the same source.
Religion exists because sin exists. - You get one, you get the other.

####Change the mindset
Religion is the fruit of a belief system.
Religion is a behavior built from a set of values that come from a belief system.
Change the belief, change the values.
Change the values, change the behavior.
Change the behavior, change the religion.


####Thoughts for your week:
Legalism and liberalism both narrow broadness. Let’s live according to the gospel which truly leads to a broad life.
