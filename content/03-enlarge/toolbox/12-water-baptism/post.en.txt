Text: 

For the last 2000 years, since Christ started the Church – people like you and me have been making the decision to go public with their faith in Jesus.

The Word baptism comes from a Greek word baptizo meaning to dip, immerse, plunge or submerge. Water baptism involves total immersion in water and therefore is not the same as sprinkling water on someone. 

So what do we do? Keep on sinning so God can keep on forgiving? I should hope not! If we've left the country where sin is sovereign, how can we still live in our old house there? Or didn't you realize we packed up and left there for good? That is what happened in baptism. When we went under the water, we left the old country of sin behind; when we came up out of the water, we entered into the new country of grace - a new life in a new land! |  ROMANS 6:1-3 MSG
 
When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened | LUKE 3:21 
 
Water baptism  
- is following the example of Jesus
- involves total immersion in water
- is a public declaration to our family & friends of our faith
- is an outward sign of the inward change
- symbolizes the burial of your old life and resurrection of your new life
- represents a separation from old life and a commitment to a new life in Christ
- confirms your identity
- confirms your acceptance
- confirms your approval
- reveals our submission & obedience to Christ
 
Water baptism is a special moment in a believer’s life and we at Berlin Connect believe that this special moment is best shared in the company of family and friends who know your story and have shared in your life’s journey.

It is an act of obedience and therefore strengthens our commitment to going the distance in living the Christian life.
