**Key Points:**
1. When inviting people to follow Him, Jesus simply took on a “Come and See” attitude.
2. He invited people to join His everyday life and experience the good news themselves.
3. We can learn from Jesus a “Come and See” example and apply to our lifes as we overcome our fears of telling people about God and inviting them to church.

**Key Scriptures + Concepts: **
**John 1:35 NKJV**
35 Again, the next day, John stood with two of his disciples. 36 And looking at Jesus as He walked, he said, “Behold the Lamb of God!” 37 The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. 38 **Then Jesus turned, and seeing them following, said to them, “What do you seek?” They said to Him,** “Rabbi” (which is to say, when translated, Teacher), **“where are You staying?” 39 He said to them, “Come and see.”** They came and saw where He was staying, and remained with Him that day (now it was about the tenth hour).
<br>
**John 1:45 NKJV **
43 The following day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee, and He found Philip and said to him,“Follow Me.” 44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. 45 Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” 46 And Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.” 47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him, and said of him, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!” 48 Nathanael said to Him, “How do You know me?”Jesus answered and said to him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” 49 Nathanael answered and said to Him, “Rabbi, You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!” 50 Jesus answered and said to him, “Because I said to you, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these.” 51 And He said to him, “Most assuredly, I say to you, hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”
<br>
**Genesis 28:16 NLT **
16 Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely the Lord is in this place, and I wasn’t even aware of it!” 17 But he was also afraid and said, “What an awesome place this is! It is none other than the house of God, the very gateway to heaven!

**Jesus as the best example of what a “Come and See” attitude looks like**
We might tell more people about a bad experience then about a good experience. How does this affect us with regard to the greatest news, the greatest experience - that we have met Jesus?
When the two disciples asked Jesus “where are You staying?”, He just casually replied “Come and See”. He did not make a spiritual statement. Similarly, we can see Jesus throughout the bible sharing a meal with people, all kinds of people. Jesus just wanted to spend time with people. There was an atmosphere of people having a good time together. All it sometimes takes to share your life with God is to take time to spend with people.

**Fruits of a “Come and See” attitude**
- Will not always lead to an instant result.
- People you bring along to church will go on to do greater things than you.
- Will lead to transformation.
- Will avoid religious arguments.
- People will start living for a cause greater than themselves.
<br>
**Conclusion:**
Everyday life provides us with lots of opportunities to invite people to Church. Jesus has shown us that we do not need to make spiritual statements but can just casually invite people with a “Come and See” attitude.

**Thoughts for your week: **
Are you hesitant to tell people about your experience of meeting Jesus? Overcome your hesitation by taking on a “Come and See” attitude.
