**KEY POINTS:**
1. When you say ‘yes’ to Jesus and then start hesitating a double minded gap is created. 
2. The pressure to close the gap is not on you.
3. The answer to closing the gaps is to say ‘yes’ – ‘Yes’ to the best gap-closer that ever existed: Jesus.
<br>
**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS: **
**The double minded gap**
When you ask people the question of whether they want to lead or take responsibility, not a lot of people say ‘yes’. But if you ask people if they want to care, help and lift people, or if they want to change the world to be a better place, lots of people say ‘yes’. So there is clearly a gap in understanding what leadership means. If you want to be able to say ‘no’, then you need to learn to say ‘yes’ first. God wants to prepare your future with your ‘yes’, not your ‘no’. Let your ‘yes’ define what you say ‘no’ to. If you say ‘yes’ to Jesus and then start hesitating – this creates a double minded gap.
<br>
**The answer to close the gap is to say ‘yes’ to the best gap-closer there has ever been: Jesus **
How do you know what to say ‘yes’ to and what to say ‘no’ to? What is it that will help you to close the gap? When you face a gap, just come and ask God for His help because God will help you close the gap! He is the best gap-closer there has ever been! 
<br>
The pressure is not on you to close the gap, the pressure is on Him and the simple answer to close the gaps is to say ‘yes’:
- Yes to a life with Jesus
- Yes to generousity
- Yes to helping people
<br>
AND
- No to fear 
- No to hesitation
- No to negativity
<br>
**CONCLUSION:**
God is the greatest gap-closer that has ever been. It is not on you to close the gaps in your life. All you need to do is to say ‘yes’ to a life with Jesus. Consider saying ‘yes’ to Him in your weakness, to saying ‘yes’ to Him making up the difference in the gap in your life and do not pull back or hesitate because of fear. As He is the one who starts us, who keeps us in it and who will take us to the end.
