**Key Scriptures + Concepts:**
1. Serve people because he served you!
2. Because you have been treated generously, now you can be generous.
3. Where there is generosity there are no strings attached, because it is love and hospitality which gives people hope.
<br>
**Matthew 9:35-38(MSG)**
35-38 Then Jesus made a circuit of all the towns and villages. He taught in their meeting places, reported kingdom news, and healed their diseased bodies, healed their bruised and hurt lives. When he looked out over the crowds, his heart broke. So confused and aimless they were, like sheep with no shepherd. “What a huge harvest!” he said to his disciples. “How few workers! On your knees and pray for harvest hands!”
<br>
**Matthew 10: 5-10 (MSG)**
Jesus sent his twelve harvest hands out with this charge:“Don’t begin by traveling to some far-off place to convert unbelievers. And don’t try to be dramatic by tackling some public enemy. Go to the lost, confused people right here in the neighborhood. Tell them that the kingdom is here. Bring health to the sick. Raise the dead. Touch the untouchables. Kick out the demons. You have been treated generously, so live generously. “Don’t think you have to put on a fund-raising campaign before you start. You don’t need a lot of equipment. You are the equipment, and all you need to keep that going is three meals a day. Travel light.
<br>
**We can be generous**
If we look at our city, we can see the massive opportunities before us. This is our harvest. We are placed in this city at this time because God wants to use us as harvest hands but, harvest hands can not be harvest hands without being generous hands. Our world today doesn’t value generosity. By becoming closer to Christ, we become more generous.
<br>
**Because Christ was generous**
In order for us to make an impact and be the ‘harvest hands’ of Christ, we need to realize that first we are loved by God. We were bought at a price, and expensive price. As God came from heaven to earth, to us!  When we get this revelation, we see that God was extremely generous. Sacrificing His Son on the cross is the greatest generous act!
<br>
**1 Peter 4: 8-11 (MSG)**
Love makes up for practically anything. Be quick to give a meal to the hungry, a bed to the homeless—cheerfully. Be generous with the different things God gave you, passing them around so all get in on it: if words, let it be God’s words; if help, let it be God’s hearty help. That way, God’s bright presence will be evident in everything through Jesus, and he’ll get all the credit as the One mighty in everything—encores to the end of time. Oh, yes!
<br>
**Conclusion:**
We live in a city with a massive opportunity - our harvest- and God is looking for harvest hand. Be realizing the love Christ has for you, and seeing that was extremely generous with bringing us home, we in turn can be generous with those around us. 
<br>
**Thoughts for your week:**
By being generous, you are shining and being a light in the environment
you are in. This gives the people around you the opportunity to meet Christ!
Where in you life can you be more generous? This week, we have dinner party in the park - can you invite someone to take their place at the table?
