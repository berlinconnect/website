**Week 10**
<br>
By adopting us as "sons" into His family, God gives us 
1. deep security about our status with Him 
2. intimate access to Him 
3. a future inheritance of the new heavens and new earth 
 
When we don't realise who we are in Christ, our faith (trust) will be crippled. 
If you don't feel worthy to exercise your authority in Christ then you will never benefit from all that Christ has provided for you. We can allow wrong thinking to make us feel unworthy which robs us of the opportunity to walk in the power of God here on earth. 

The truth is the Blood of Christ makes us worthy and by God’s grace He creates a brand new spirit in us and gives us the tools to renew our mind, which renews our brain and brings health to our bodies… 

Rom 12: Be transformed by the renewing of your mind. 
 
**Colossians 1:26-29 Message **
The mystery in a nutshell is just this: Christ is in you, so therefore you can look forward to sharing in God’s glory. It’s that simple. That is the substance of our Message. We preach Christ, warning people not to add to the Message. We teach in a spirit of profound common sense so that we can bring each person to maturity. To be mature is to be basic. Christ No more, no less. That’s what I’m working so hard at day after day, year after year, doing my best with the energy God so generously gives me. Be encouraged today and remind yourself of your true place in Christ.
